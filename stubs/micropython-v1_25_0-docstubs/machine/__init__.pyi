Functions related to the hardware.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.25.0/library/machine.html

The ``machine`` module contains specific functions related to the hardware
on a particular board. Most functions in this module allow to achieve direct
and unrestricted access to and control of hardware blocks on a system
(like CPU, timers, buses, etc.). Used incorrectly, this can lead to
malfunction, lockups, crashes of your board, and in extreme cases, hardware
damage.

      - ``0`` for "high low" pulse duration modulation. This will transmit 0 and
        1 bits as timed pulses, starting with the most significant bit.
