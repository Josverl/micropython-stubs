    Return the list of the currently available media input and output devices,
    such as microphones, cameras, headsets, and so forth.

    Output:

        list(dict) - list of dictionaries representing the available media devices.
            Each dictionary has the following keys:
            * deviceId: a string that is an identifier for the represented device
                that is persisted across sessions. It is un-guessable by other
                applications and unique to the origin of the calling application.
                It is reset when the user clears cookies (for Private Browsing, a
                different identifier is used that is not persisted across sessions).

            * groupId: a string that is a group identifier. Two devices have the same
                group identifier if they belong to the same physical device â€” for
                example a monitor with both a built-in camera and a microphone.

            * kind: an enumerated value that is either "videoinput", "audioinput"
                or "audiooutput".

            * label: a string describing this device (for example "External USB
                Webcam").

    Note: the returned list will omit any devices that are blocked by the document
    Permission Policy: microphone, camera, speaker-selection (for output devices),
    and so on. Access to particular non-default devices is also gated by the
    Permissions API, and the list will omit devices for which the user has not
    granted explicit permission.
