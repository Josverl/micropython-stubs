# Partial stub files 


These partial files contain some classess that need to be manually added to the final stubs file.

it is a bit of a workaround, but it avoids some issues with the current implementation of the stubs generator,
and is a lot less code to write and maintain, and as the goal is to have the stubs being maintained manualy by the community, it is a good tradeoff.
