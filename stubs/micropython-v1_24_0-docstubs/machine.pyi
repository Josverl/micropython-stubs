Functions related to the hardware.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.24.0/library/machine.html

The ``machine`` module contains specific functions related to the hardware
on a particular board. Most functions in this module allow to achieve direct
and unrestricted access to and control of hardware blocks on a system
(like CPU, timers, buses, etc.). Used incorrectly, this can lead to
malfunction, lockups, crashes of your board, and in extreme cases, hardware
damage.

class Pin:
    """
    Access the pin peripheral (GPIO pin) associated with the given ``id``.  If
    additional arguments are given in the constructor then they are used to initialise
    the pin.  Any settings that are not specified will remain in their previous state.

    The arguments are:

      - ``id`` is mandatory and can be an arbitrary object.  Among possible value
        types are: int (an internal Pin identifier), str (a Pin name), and tuple
        (pair of [port, pin]).

      - ``mode`` specifies the pin mode, which can be one of:

        - ``Pin.IN`` - Pin is configured for input.  If viewed as an output the pin
          is in high-impedance state.

        - ``Pin.OUT`` - Pin is configured for (normal) output.

        - ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` - Pin is configured for open-drain output. Open-drain
          output works in the following way: if the output value is set to 0 the pin
          is active at a low level; if the output value is 1 the pin is in a high-impedance
          state.  Not all ports implement this mode, or some might only on certain pins.

        - ``Pin.ALT`` - Pin is configured to perform an alternative function, which is
          port specific.  For a pin configured in such a way any other Pin methods
          (except :meth:`Pin.init`) are not applicable (calling them will lead to undefined,
          or a hardware-specific, result).  Not all ports implement this mode.

        - ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN`` - The Same as ``Pin.ALT``, but the pin is configured as
          open-drain.  Not all ports implement this mode.

        - ``Pin.ANALOG`` - Pin is configured for analog input, see the :class:`ADC` class.

      - ``pull`` specifies if the pin has a (weak) pull resistor attached, and can be
        one of:

        - ``None`` - No pull up or down resistor.
        - ``Pin.PULL_UP`` - Pull up resistor enabled.
        - ``Pin.PULL_DOWN`` - Pull down resistor enabled.

      - ``value`` is valid only for Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN modes and specifies initial
        output pin value if given, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains
        unchanged.

      - ``drive`` specifies the output power of the pin and can be one of: ``Pin.DRIVE_0``,
        ``Pin.DRIVE_1``, etc., increasing in drive strength.  The actual current driving
        capabilities are port dependent.  Not all ports implement this argument.

      - ``alt`` specifies an alternate function for the pin and the values it can take are
        port dependent.  This argument is valid only for ``Pin.ALT`` and ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN``
        modes.  It may be used when a pin supports more than one alternate function.  If only
        one pin alternate function is supported the this argument is not required.  Not all
        ports implement this argument.

    As specified above, the Pin class allows to set an alternate function for a particular
    pin, but it does not specify any further operations on such a pin.  Pins configured in
    alternate-function mode are usually not used as GPIO but are instead driven by other
    hardware peripherals.  The only operation supported on such a pin is re-initialising,
    by calling the constructor or :meth:`Pin.init` method.  If a pin that is configured in
    alternate-function mode is re-initialised with ``Pin.IN``, ``Pin.OUT``, or
    ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN``, the alternate function will be removed from the pin.

        the pin, returning 0 or 1 corresponding to low and high voltage signals
        respectively.  The behaviour of this method depends on the mode of the pin:

           trigger source is the output buffer of the pin.  Otherwise, if the pin mode
           is ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` then the trigger source is the output buffer for
           state '0' and the external pin value for state '1'.

           The arguments are:

             - ``handler`` is an optional function to be called when the interrupt
               triggers. The handler must take exactly one argument which is the
               ``Pin`` instance.

             - ``trigger`` configures the event which can generate an interrupt.
               Possible values are:

               - ``Pin.IRQ_FALLING`` interrupt on falling edge.
               - ``Pin.IRQ_RISING`` interrupt on rising edge.
               - ``Pin.IRQ_LOW_LEVEL`` interrupt on low level.
               - ``Pin.IRQ_HIGH_LEVEL`` interrupt on high level.

               These values can be OR'ed together to trigger on multiple events.

             - ``priority`` sets the priority level of the interrupt.  The values it
               can take are port-specific, but higher values always represent higher
               priorities.

             - ``wake`` selects the power mode in which this interrupt can wake up the
               system.  It can be ``machine.IDLE``, ``machine.SLEEP`` or ``machine.DEEPSLEEP``.
               These values can also be OR'ed together to make a pin generate interrupts in
               more than one power mode.

             - ``hard`` if true a hardware interrupt is used. This reduces the delay
               between the pin change and the handler being called. Hard interrupt
               handlers may not allocate memory; see :ref:`isr_rules`.

        Initialise the UART bus with the given parameters:

          - *baudrate* is the clock rate.
          - *bits* is the number of bits per character, 7, 8 or 9.
          - *parity* is the parity, ``None``, 0 (even) or 1 (odd).
          - *stop* is the number of stop bits, 1 or 2.

        Additional keyword-only parameters that may be supported by a port are:

          - *tx* specifies the TX pin to use.
          - *rx* specifies the RX pin to use.
          - *rts* specifies the RTS (output) pin to use for hardware receive flow control.
          - *cts* specifies the CTS (input) pin to use for hardware transmit flow control.

          - *timeout_char* specifies the time to wait between characters (in ms).
          - *invert* specifies which lines to invert.

              - ``0`` will not invert lines (idle state of both lines is logic high).
              - ``UART.INV_TX`` will invert TX line (idle state of TX line now logic low).
              - ``UART.INV_RX`` will invert RX line (idle state of RX line now logic low).
              - ``UART.INV_TX | UART.INV_RX`` will invert both lines (idle state at logic low).

          - *flow* specifies which hardware flow control signals to use. The value
            is a bitmask.

              - ``0`` will ignore hardware flow control signals.
              - ``UART.RTS`` will enable receive flow control by using the RTS output pin to
                signal if the receive FIFO has sufficient space to accept more data.
              - ``UART.CTS`` will enable transmit flow control by pausing transmission when the
                CTS input pin signals that the receiver is running low on buffer space.
              - ``UART.RTS | UART.CTS`` will enable both, for full hardware flow control.

        On the WiPy only the following keyword-only parameter is supported:

          - *pins* is a 4 or 2 item list indicating the TX, RX, RTS and CTS pins (in that order).
            Any of the pins can be None if one wants the UART to operate with limited functionality.
            If the RTS pin is given the the RX pin must be given as well. The same applies to CTS.
            When no pins are given, then the default set of TX and RX pins is taken, and hardware
            flow control will be disabled. If *pins* is ``None``, no pin assignment will be made.

        .. note::
          It is possible to call ``init()`` multiple times on the same object in
          order to reconfigure  UART on the fly. That allows using single UART
          peripheral to serve different devices attached to different GPIO pins.
          Only one device can be served at a time in that case.

        - ``desc_cfg`` - A bytes-like object containing the
          new USB configuration descriptor.

        - ``desc_strs`` - Optional object holding strings or bytes objects
           containing USB string descriptor values. Can be a list, a dict, or any
           object which supports subscript indexing with integer keys (USB string
           descriptor index).

           Strings are an optional USB feature, and this parameter can be unset
           (default) if no strings are referenced in the device and configuration
           descriptors, or if only built-in strings should be used.

           Apart from index 0, all the string values should be plain ASCII. Index 0
           is the special "languages" USB descriptor, represented as a bytes object
           with a custom format defined in the USB standard. ``None`` can be
           returned at index 0 in order to use a default "English" language
           descriptor.

           To fall back to providing a built-in string value for a given index, a
           subscript lookup can return ``None``, raise ``KeyError``, or raise
           ``IndexError``.

        - ``open_itf_cb`` - This callback is called once for each interface
          or Interface Association Descriptor in response to a Set
          Configuration request from the USB Host (the final stage before
          the USB device is available to the host).

          The callback takes a single argument, which is a memoryview of the
          interface or IAD descriptor that the host is accepting (including
          all associated descriptors). It is a view into the same
          ``desc_cfg`` object that was provided as a separate
          argument to this function. The memoryview is only valid until the
          callback function returns.

        - ``reset_cb`` - This callback is called when the USB host performs
          a bus reset. The callback takes no arguments. Any in-progress
          transfers will never complete. The USB host will most likely
          proceed to re-enumerate the USB device by calling the descriptor
          callbacks and then ``open_itf_cb()``.

        - ``control_xfer_cb`` - This callback is called one or more times
          for each USB control transfer (device Endpoint 0). It takes two
          arguments.

          The first argument is the control transfer stage. It is one of:

          - ``1`` for SETUP stage.
          - ``2`` for DATA stage.
          - ``3`` for ACK stage.

          Second argument is a memoryview to read the USB control request
          data for this stage. The memoryview is only valid until the
          callback function returns. Data in this memoryview will be the same
          across each of the three stages of a single transfer.

          A successful transfer consists of this callback being called in sequence
          for the three stages. Generally speaking, if a device wants to do
          something in response to a control request then it's best to wait until
          the ACK stage to confirm the host controller completed the transfer as
          expected.

          The callback should return one of the following values:

          - ``False`` to stall the endpoint and reject the transfer. It won't
            proceed to any remaining stages.
          - ``True`` to continue the transfer to the next stage.
          - A buffer object can be returned at the SETUP stage when the transfer
            will send or receive additional data. Typically this is the case when
            the ``wLength`` field in the request has a non-zero value. This should
            be a writable buffer for an ``OUT`` direction transfer, or a readable
            buffer with data for an ``IN`` direction transfer.

        - ``xfer_cb`` - This callback is called whenever a non-control
          transfer submitted by calling :func:`USBDevice.submit_xfer` completes.

          The callback has three arguments:

          1. The Endpoint number for the completed transfer.
          2. Result value: ``True`` if the transfer succeeded, ``False``
             otherwise.
          3. Number of bytes successfully transferred. In the case of a
             "short" transfer, The result is ``True`` and ``xferred_bytes``
             will be smaller than the length of the buffer submitted for the
             transfer.

          ``Note:`` If a bus reset occurs (see :func:`USBDevice.reset`),
                    ``xfer_cb`` is not called for any transfers that have not
                    already completed.

    highly dependent on the underlying hardware, but the general properties are:

    * A lightsleep has full RAM and state retention.  Upon wake execution is resumed
      from the point where the sleep was requested, with all subsystems operational.

    * A deepsleep may not retain RAM or any other state of the system (for example
      peripherals or network interfaces).  Upon wake execution is resumed from the main
      script, similar to a hard or power-on reset. The `reset_cause()` function will
      return `machine.DEEPSLEEP` and this can be used to distinguish a deepsleep wake
      from other resets.

    Transmits *data* by bit-banging the specified *pin*. The *encoding* argument

    The supported encodings are:

      - ``0`` for "high low" pulse duration modulation. This will transmit 0 and
        1 bits as timed pulses, starting with the most significant bit.
        The *timing* must be a four-tuple of nanoseconds in the format
        ``(high_time_0, low_time_0, high_time_1, low_time_1)``. For example,
        ``(400, 850, 800, 450)`` is the timing specification for WS2812 RGB LEDs
        at 800kHz.

    The accuracy of the timing varies between ports. On Cortex M0 at 48MHz, it is
    at best +/- 120ns, however on faster MCUs (ESP8266, ESP32, STM32, Pyboard), it
    will be closer to +/-30ns.
