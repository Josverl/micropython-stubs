TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.22.1/library/ssl.html

CPython module: :mod:`python:ssl` https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html .

This module provides access to Transport Layer Security (previously and
widely known as “Secure Sockets Layer”) encryption and peer authentication
facilities for network sockets, both client-side and server-side.

     Wrap the given *sock* and return a new wrapped-socket object.  The implementation
     of this function is to first create an `SSLContext` and then call the `SSLContext.wrap_socket`
     method on that context object.  The arguments *sock*, *server_side* and *server_hostname* are
     passed through unchanged to the method call.  The argument *do_handshake* is passed through as
     *do_handshake_on_connect*.  The remaining arguments have the following behaviour:

    - *cert_reqs* determines whether the peer (server or client) must present a valid certificate.
      Note that for mbedtls based ports, ``ssl.CERT_NONE`` and ``ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL`` will not
      validate any certificate, only ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`` will.

    - *cadata* is a bytes object containing the CA certificate chain (in DER format) that will
      validate the peer's certificate.  Currently only a single DER-encoded certificate is supported.

    Depending on the underlying module implementation in a particular
    :term:`MicroPython port`, some or all keyword arguments above may be not supported.

        """
        Takes a `stream` *sock* (usually socket.socket instance of ``SOCK_STREAM`` type),
        and returns an instance of ssl.SSLSocket, wrapping the underlying stream.
        The returned object has the usual `stream` interface methods like
        ``read()``, ``write()``, etc.

        - *server_side* selects whether the wrapped socket is on the server or client side.
          A server-side SSL socket should be created from a normal socket returned from
          :meth:`~socket.socket.accept()` on a non-SSL listening server socket.

        - *do_handshake_on_connect* determines whether the handshake is done as part of the ``wrap_socket``
          or whether it is deferred to be done as part of the initial reads or writes
          For blocking sockets doing the handshake immediately is standard. For non-blocking
          sockets (i.e. when the *sock* passed into ``wrap_socket`` is in non-blocking mode)
          the handshake should generally be deferred because otherwise ``wrap_socket`` blocks
          until it completes. Note that in AXTLS the handshake can be deferred until the first
          read or write but it then blocks until completion.

        - *server_hostname* is for use as a client, and sets the hostname to check against the received
          server certificate.  It also sets the name for Server Name Indication (SNI), allowing the server
          to present the proper certificate.

        Difference to CPython

           MicroPython extension: *certfile* and *keyfile* can be bytes objects instead of
           strings, in which case they are interpreted as the actual certificate/key data.
