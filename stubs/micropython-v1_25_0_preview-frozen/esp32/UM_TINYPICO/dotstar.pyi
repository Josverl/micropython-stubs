class DotStar:
    """
    A sequence of dotstars.

    :param SPI spi: The SPI object to write output to.
    :param int n: The number of dotstars in the chain
    :param float brightness: Brightness of the pixels between 0.0 and 1.0
    :param bool auto_write: True if the dotstars should immediately change when
        set. If False, `show` must be called explicitly.
    :param tuple pixel_order: Set the pixel order on the strip - different
         strips implement this differently. If you send red, and it looks blue
         or green on the strip, modify this! It should be one of the values above


    Example for TinyPICO:

    .. code-block:: python

        from dotstar import DotStar
        from machine import Pin, SPI

        spi = SPI(sck=Pin(12), mosi=Pin(13), miso=Pin(18)) # Configure SPI - note: miso is unused
        dotstar = DotStar(spi, 1)
        dotstar[0] = (128, 0, 0) # Red

        Important notes about the per-pixel brightness - it's accomplished by
        PWMing the entire output of the LED, and that PWM is at a much
        slower clock than the rest of the LEDs. This can cause problems in
