    Create a LAN driver object, initialise the LAN module using the given
    PHY driver name, and return the LAN object.

    Arguments are:

      - *id* is the number of the Ethernet port, either 0 or 1.
      - *phy_type* is the name of the PHY driver. For most board the on-board PHY has to be used and
        is the default. Suitable values are port specific.
      - *phy_addr* specifies the address of the PHY interface. As with *phy_type*, the hardwired value has
        to be used for most boards and that value is the default.
      - *ref_clk_mode* specifies, whether the data clock is provided by the Ethernet controller or
        the PYH interface.
        The default value is the one that matches the board. If set to ``LAN.OUT`` or ``Pin.OUT``
        or ``True``, the clock is driven by the Ethernet controller, if set to ``LAN.IN``
        or ``Pin.IN`` or ``False``, the clock is driven by the PHY interface.

    For example, with the Seeed Arch Mix board you can  use::

      nic = LAN(0, phy_type=LAN.PHY_LAN8720, phy_addr=1, ref_clk_mode=Pin.IN)
