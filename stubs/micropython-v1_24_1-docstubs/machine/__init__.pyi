"""
Functions related to the hardware.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.24.0/library/machine.html

The ``machine`` module contains specific functions related to the hardware
on a particular board. Most functions in this module allow to achieve direct
and unrestricted access to and control of hardware blocks on a system
(like CPU, timers, buses, etc.). Used incorrectly, this can lead to
malfunction, lockups, crashes of your board, and in extreme cases, hardware
damage.

    continuously checking for an external change (i.e. polling). This will reduce

    The supported encodings are:

      - ``0`` for "high low" pulse duration modulation. This will transmit 0 and
        1 bits as timed pulses, starting with the most significant bit.
        The *timing* must be a four-tuple of nanoseconds in the format
        ``(high_time_0, low_time_0, high_time_1, low_time_1)``. For example,
        ``(400, 850, 800, 450)`` is the timing specification for WS2812 RGB LEDs

    at best +/- 120ns, however on faster MCUs (ESP8266, ESP32, STM32, Pyboard), it
