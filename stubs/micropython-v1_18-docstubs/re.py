regular expressions. See: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.18/library/re.html

|see_cpython_module| :mod:`python:re` https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html .

This module implements regular expression operations. Regular expression
syntax supported is a subset of CPython ``re`` module (and actually is
a subset of POSIX extended regular expressions).

Supported operators and special sequences are:

``.``
   Match any character.

``[...]``
   Match set of characters. Individual characters and ranges are supported,
   including negated sets (e.g. ``[^a-c]``).

``^``
   Match the start of the string.

``$``
   Match the end of the string.

``?``
   Match zero or one of the previous sub-pattern.

``*``
   Match zero or more of the previous sub-pattern.

``+``
   Match one or more of the previous sub-pattern.

``??``
   Non-greedy version of ``?``, match zero or one, with the preference
   for zero.

``*?``
   Non-greedy version of ``*``, match zero or more, with the preference
   for the shortest match.

``+?``
   Non-greedy version of ``+``, match one or more, with the preference
   for the shortest match.

``|``
   Match either the left-hand side or the right-hand side sub-patterns of
   this operator.

``(...)``
   Grouping. Each group is capturing (a substring it captures can be accessed
   with `match.group()` method).

``\d``
   Matches digit. Equivalent to ``[0-9]``.

``\D``
   Matches non-digit. Equivalent to ``[^0-9]``.

``\s``
   Matches whitespace. Equivalent to ``[ \t-\r]``.

``\S``
   Matches non-whitespace. Equivalent to ``[^ \t-\r]``.

``\w``
   Matches "word characters" (ASCII only). Equivalent to ``[A-Za-z0-9_]``.

``\W``
   Matches non "word characters" (ASCII only). Equivalent to ``[^A-Za-z0-9_]``.

``\``
   Escape character. Any other character following the backslash, except
   for those listed above, is taken literally. For example, ``\*`` is
   equivalent to literal ``*`` (not treated as the ``*`` operator).
   Note that ``\r``, ``\n``, etc. are not handled specially, and will be
   equivalent to literal letters ``r``, ``n``, etc. Due to this, it's
   not recommended to use raw Python strings (``r""``) for regular
   expressions. For example, ``r"\r\n"`` when used as the regular
   expression is equivalent to ``"rn"``. To match CR character followed
   by LF, use ``"\r\n"``.

**NOT SUPPORTED**:

* counted repetitions (``{m,n}``)
* named groups (``(?P<name>...)``)
* non-capturing groups (``(?:...)``)
* more advanced assertions (``\b``, ``\B``)
* special character escapes like ``\r``, ``\n`` - use Python's own escaping
  instead
* etc.

Example::

    import re

    # As re doesn't support escapes itself, use of r"" strings is not
    # recommended.
    regex = re.compile("[\r\n]")

    regex.split("line1\rline2\nline3\r\n")

    # Result:
    # ['line1', 'line2', 'line3', '', '']
