"""
access binary data in a structured way. See: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.18/library/uctypes.html

This module implements "foreign data interface" for MicroPython. The idea
behind it is similar to CPython's ``ctypes`` modules, but the actual API is
different, streamlined and optimized for small size. The basic idea of the
module is to define data structure layout with about the same power as the
C language allows, and then access it using familiar dot-syntax to reference
sub-fields.

BIG_ENDIAN: Any

FLOAT64: Any
#    ``VOID`` is an alias for ``UINT8``, and is provided to conveniently define

VOID: Any
