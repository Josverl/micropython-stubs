mathematical functions for complex numbers. See: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.18/library/cmath.html

|see_cpython_module| :mod:`python:cmath` https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html .

The ``cmath`` module provides some basic mathematical functions for
working with complex numbers.

Availability: not available on WiPy and ESP8266. Floating point support
required for this module.
