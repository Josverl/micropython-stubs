# Use subscript notation ``[...]`` to index these objects with the address of

#
# These memory objects can be used in combination with the peripheral register
# constants to read and write registers of the MCU hardware peripherals, as well
# as all other areas of address space.

mem32: int
#     Base address of the GPIOA peripheral.
GPIOA: int
#     Base address of the GPIOB peripheral.
GPIOB: int
#     Offset of the GPIO bit set/reset register.
GPIO_BSRR: Any
#     Offset of the GPIO input data register.
GPIO_IDR: Any
#     Offset of the GPIO output data register.
#
# Constants that are named after a peripheral, like ``GPIOA``, are the absolute
# address of that peripheral.  Constants that have a prefix which is the name of a
# peripheral, like ``GPIO_BSRR``, are relative offsets of the register.  Accessing
# peripheral registers requires adding the absolute base address of the peripheral
# and the relative register offset.  For example ``GPIOA + GPIO_BSRR`` is the
# full, absolute address of the ``GPIOA->BSRR`` register.
#
# Example use:
