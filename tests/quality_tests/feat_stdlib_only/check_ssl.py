    Note: This function creates a fairly limited SSL context object to enable
    the use of certificates under MicroPython. It is not intended to be used in
    any other context, and in particular, it is not needed when using CPython
    or any other Python implementation that has native support for
    ``SSLContext`` objects. Once MicroPython implements ``SSLContext``
    natively, this function will be deprecated.
