"""
Random numbers.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.21.0/library/random.html

This module implements a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).

CPython module: :mod:`python:random` https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html . .

.. note::

   The following notation is used for intervals:

   - () are open interval brackets and do not include their endpoints.
     For example, (0, 1) means greater than 0 and less than 1.
     In set notation: (0, 1) = {x | 0 < x < 1}.

   - [] are closed interval brackets which include all their limit points.
     For example, [0, 1] means greater than or equal to 0 and less than
     or equal to 1.
     In set notation: [0, 1] = {x | 0 <= x <= 1}.

.. note::

   The :func:`randrange`, :func:`randint` and :func:`choice` functions are only
   available if the ``MICROPY_PY_RANDOM_EXTRA_FUNCS`` configuration option is
   enabled.
