    explanation, along with various techniques for debouncing.

    Trying to register 2 callbacks onto the same pin will throw an exception.

class I2C:

    I2C is a two-wire protocol for communicating between devices.  At the physical
    level it consists of 2 wires: SCL and SDA, the clock and data lines respectively.

    I2C objects are created attached to a specific bus.  They can be initialised
    when created, or initialised later on.

    Example::

        from pyb import I2C

        i2c = I2C(1)                             # create on bus 1
        i2c = I2C(1, I2C.CONTROLLER)             # create and init as a controller

        i2c.init(I2C.PERIPHERAL, addr=0x42)      # init as a peripheral with given address
        i2c.deinit()                             # turn off the I2C unit

    Printing the i2c object gives you information about its configuration.

    The basic methods are send and recv::

        i2c.send('abc')      # send 3 bytes
        i2c.send(0x42)       # send a single byte, given by the number
        data = i2c.recv(3)   # receive 3 bytes

    To receive inplace, first create a bytearray::

        data = bytearray(3)  # create a buffer
        i2c.recv(data)       # receive 3 bytes, writing them into data

    You can specify a timeout (in ms)::

        i2c.send(b'123', timeout=2000)   # timeout after 2 seconds

    A controller must specify the recipient's address::

        i2c.init(I2C.CONTROLLER)
        i2c.send('123', 0x42)        # send 3 bytes to peripheral with address 0x42
        i2c.send(b'456', addr=0x42)  # keyword for address

    Master also has other methods::

        i2c.is_ready(0x42)           # check if peripheral 0x42 is ready
        i2c.scan()                   # scan for peripherals on the bus, returning
                                     #   a list of valid addresses

        16 bits or greater.  If ``buf`` has only 8-bit elements (eg a bytearray) then
        the sample resolution will be reduced to 8 bits.

        ``timer`` should be a Timer object, and a sample is read each time the timer

        This is a static method. It can be used to extract relative timing or
        phase data from multiple ADC's.

        It reads analog values from multiple ADC's into buffers at a rate set by
        the *timer* object. Each time the timer triggers a sample is rapidly
        read from each ADC in turn.

        ADC and buffer instances are passed in tuples with each ADC having an
        associated buffer. All buffers must be of the same type and length and
        the number of buffers must equal the number of ADC's.

        Buffers can be ``bytearray`` or ``array.array`` for example. The ADC values
        have 12-bit resolution and are stored directly into the buffer if its element
        size is 16 bits or greater.  If buffers have only 8-bit elements (eg a

        timing. At high sample rates the time taken to acquire a set of samples
        can exceed the timer period. In this case the function returns ``False``,
        indicating a loss of precision in the sample interval. In extreme cases
        samples may be missed.

        The maximum rate depends on factors including the data width and the
        number of ADC's being read. In testing two ADC's were sampled at a timer
        rate of 210kHz without overrun. Samples were missed at 215kHz.  For three
        ADC's the limit is around 140kHz, and for four it is around 110kHz.
        At high sample rates disabling interrupts for the duration can reduce the
        risk of sporadic data loss.

class Timer:
    """
    Timers can be used for a great variety of tasks.  At the moment, only
    the simplest case is implemented: that of calling a function periodically.

    Each timer consists of a counter that counts up at a certain rate.  The rate
    at which it counts is the peripheral clock frequency (in Hz) divided by the
    timer prescaler.  When the counter reaches the timer period it triggers an
    event, and the counter resets back to zero.  By using the callback method,
    the timer event can call a Python function.

    Example usage to toggle an LED at a fixed frequency::

        tim = pyb.Timer(4)              # create a timer object using timer 4
        tim.init(freq=2)                # trigger at 2Hz
        tim.callback(lambda t:pyb.LED(1).toggle())

    Example using named function for the callback::

        def tick(timer):                # we will receive the timer object when being called
            print(timer.counter())      # show current timer's counter value
        tim = pyb.Timer(4, freq=1)      # create a timer object using timer 4 - trigger at 1Hz
        tim.callback(tick)              # set the callback to our tick function

    Further examples::

        tim = pyb.Timer(4, freq=100)    # freq in Hz
        tim = pyb.Timer(4, prescaler=0, period=99)
        tim.counter()                   # get counter (can also set)
        tim.prescaler(2)                # set prescaler (can also get)
        tim.period(199)                 # set period (can also get)
        tim.callback(lambda t: ...)     # set callback for update interrupt (t=tim instance)
        tim.callback(None)              # clear callback

    *Note:* Timer(2) and Timer(3) are used for PWM to set the intensity of LED(3)
    and LED(4) respectively.  But these timers are only configured for PWM if
    the intensity of the relevant LED is set to a value between 1 and 254.  If
    the intensity feature of the LEDs is not used then these timers are free for
    general purpose use.  Similarly, Timer(5) controls the servo driver, and
    Timer(6) is used for timed ADC/DAC reading/writing.  It is recommended to
    use the other timers in your programs.

    *Note:* Memory can't be allocated during a callback (an interrupt) and so
    exceptions raised within a callback don't give much information.  See
    :func:`micropython.alloc_emergency_exception_buf` for how to get around this
    limitation.

            - ``Timer.OC_FORCED_INACTIVE`` --- the pin is forced inactive (compare match is ignored).
            - ``Timer.IC`` --- configure the timer in Input Capture mode.
            - ``Timer.ENC_A`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter only changes when CH1 changes.
            - ``Timer.ENC_B`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter only changes when CH2 changes.
            - ``Timer.ENC_AB`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter changes when CH1 or CH2 changes.

          - ``callback`` - as per TimerChannel.callback()

          - ``pin`` None (the default) or a Pin object. If specified (and not None)
            this will cause the alternate function of the the indicated pin
            to be configured for this timer channel. An error will be raised if

        Keyword arguments for Timer.PWM modes:

          - ``pulse_width`` - determines the initial pulse width value to use.
          - ``pulse_width_percent`` - determines the initial pulse width percentage to use.

        Keyword arguments for Timer.OC modes:

          - ``compare`` - determines the initial value of the compare register.

          - ``polarity`` can be one of:

            - ``Timer.HIGH`` - output is active high
            - ``Timer.LOW`` - output is active low

        Optional keyword arguments for Timer.IC modes:

          - ``polarity`` can be one of:

            - ``Timer.RISING`` - captures on rising edge.
            - ``Timer.FALLING`` - captures on falling edge.
            - ``Timer.BOTH`` - captures on both edges.

          Note that capture only works on the primary channel, and not on the
          complimentary channels.

        Notes for Timer.ENC modes:

          - Requires 2 pins, so one or both pins will need to be configured to use
            the appropriate timer AF using the Pin API.
          - Read the encoder value using the timer.counter() method.
          - Only works on CH1 and CH2 (and not on CH1N or CH2N)
          - The channel number is ignored when setting the encoder mode.

class UART:
    """
    UART implements the standard UART/USART duplex serial communications protocol.  At
    the physical level it consists of 2 lines: RX and TX.  The unit of communication
    is a character (not to be confused with a string character) which can be 8 or 9
    bits wide.

    UART objects can be created and initialised using::

        from pyb import UART

        uart = UART(1, 9600)                         # init with given baudrate
        uart.init(9600, bits=8, parity=None, stop=1) # init with given parameters

    Bits can be 7, 8 or 9.  Parity can be None, 0 (even) or 1 (odd).  Stop can be 1 or 2.

    *Note:* with parity=None, only 8 and 9 bits are supported.  With parity enabled,
    only 7 and 8 bits are supported.

    A UART object acts like a `stream` object and reading and writing is done
    using the standard stream methods::

        uart.read(10)       # read 10 characters, returns a bytes object
        uart.read()         # read all available characters
        uart.readline()     # read a line
        uart.readinto(buf)  # read and store into the given buffer
        uart.write('abc')   # write the 3 characters

    Individual characters can be read/written using::

        uart.readchar()     # read 1 character and returns it as an integer
        uart.writechar(42)  # write 1 character

    To check if there is anything to be read, use::

        uart.any()          # returns the number of characters waiting


    *Note:* The stream functions ``read``, ``write``, etc. are new in MicroPython v1.3.4.

          - ``baudrate`` is the clock rate.
          - ``bits`` is the number of bits per character, 7, 8 or 9.
          - ``parity`` is the parity, ``None``, 0 (even) or 1 (odd).
          - ``stop`` is the number of stop bits, 1 or 2.
          - ``flow`` sets the flow control type. Can be 0, ``UART.RTS``, ``UART.CTS``
            or ``UART.RTS | UART.CTS``.
          - ``timeout`` is the timeout in milliseconds to wait for writing/reading the first character.
          - ``timeout_char`` is the timeout in milliseconds to wait between characters while writing or reading.
          - ``read_buf_len`` is the character length of the read buffer (0 to disable).

        This method will raise an exception if the baudrate could not be set within
        5% of the desired value.  The minimum baudrate is dictated by the frequency
        of the bus that the UART is on; UART(1) and UART(6) are APB2, the rest are on
        APB1.  The default bus frequencies give a minimum baudrate of 1300 for
        UART(1) and UART(6) and 650 for the others.  Use :func:`pyb.freq <pyb.freq>`
        to reduce the bus frequencies to get lower baudrates.

        *Note:* with parity=None, only 8 and 9 bits are supported.  With parity enabled,
        only 7 and 8 bits are supported.

class Pin:
    """
    A pin is the basic object to control I/O pins.  It has methods to set
    the mode of the pin (input, output, etc) and methods to get and set the
    digital logic level. For analog control of a pin, see the ADC class.

    Usage Model:

    All Board Pins are predefined as pyb.Pin.board.Name::

        x1_pin = pyb.Pin.board.X1

        g = pyb.Pin(pyb.Pin.board.X1, pyb.Pin.IN)

    CPU pins which correspond to the board pins are available
    as ``pyb.Pin.cpu.Name``. For the CPU pins, the names are the port letter
    followed by the pin number. On the PYBv1.0, ``pyb.Pin.board.X1`` and
    ``pyb.Pin.cpu.A0`` are the same pin.

    You can also use strings::

        g = pyb.Pin('X1', pyb.Pin.OUT_PP)

    Users can add their own names::

        MyMapperDict = { 'LeftMotorDir' : pyb.Pin.cpu.C12 }
        pyb.Pin.dict(MyMapperDict)
        g = pyb.Pin("LeftMotorDir", pyb.Pin.OUT_OD)

    and can query mappings::

        pin = pyb.Pin("LeftMotorDir")

    Users can also add their own mapping function::

        def MyMapper(pin_name):
           if pin_name == "LeftMotorDir":
               return pyb.Pin.cpu.A0

        pyb.Pin.mapper(MyMapper)

    So, if you were to call: ``pyb.Pin("LeftMotorDir", pyb.Pin.OUT_PP)``
    then ``"LeftMotorDir"`` is passed directly to the mapper function.

    To summarise, the following order determines how things get mapped into
    an ordinal pin number:

    1. Directly specify a pin object
    2. User supplied mapping function
    3. User supplied mapping (object must be usable as a dictionary key)
    4. Supply a string which matches a board pin
    5. Supply a string which matches a CPU port/pin

    You can set ``pyb.Pin.debug(True)`` to get some debug information about
    how a particular object gets mapped to a pin.

    When a pin has the ``Pin.PULL_UP`` or ``Pin.PULL_DOWN`` pull-mode enabled,
    that pin has an effective 40k Ohm resistor pulling it to 3V3 or GND
    respectively (except pin Y5 which has 11k Ohm resistors).

    Now every time a falling edge is seen on the gpio pin, the callback will be
    executed. Caution: mechanical push buttons have "bounce" and pushing or
    releasing a switch will often generate multiple edges.
    See: http://www.eng.utah.edu/~cs5780/debouncing.pdf for a detailed
    explanation, along with various techniques for debouncing.

    All pin objects go through the pin mapper to come up with one of the
    gpio pins.
