Network configuration.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.24.0/library/network.html

This module provides network drivers and routing configuration. To use this
module, a MicroPython variant/build with network capabilities must be installed.
Network drivers for specific hardware are available within this module and are
used to configure hardware network interface(s). Network services provided
by configured interfaces are then available for use via the :mod:`socket`
module.

For example::

    # connect/ show IP config a specific network interface
    # see below for examples of specific drivers
    import network
    import time
    nic = network.Driver(...)
    if not nic.isconnected():
        nic.connect()
        print("Waiting for connection...")
        while not nic.isconnected():
            time.sleep(1)
    print(nic.ipconfig("addr4"))

    # now use socket as usual
    import socket
    addr = socket.getaddrinfo('micropython.org', 80)[0][-1]
    s = socket.socket()
    s.connect(addr)
    s.send(b'GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: micropython.org

')
    data = s.recv(1000)
    s.close()

    Create a LAN driver object, initialise the LAN module using the given

    Arguments are:

      - *id* is the number of the Ethernet port, either 0 or 1.
      - *phy_type* is the name of the PHY driver. For most board the on-board PHY has to be used and
        is the default. Suitable values are port specific.
      - *phy_addr* specifies the address of the PHY interface. As with *phy_type*, the hardwired value has
        to be used for most boards and that value is the default.
      - *ref_clk_mode* specifies, whether the data clock is provided by the Ethernet controller or
        the PYH interface.
        The default value is the one that matches the board. If set to ``LAN.OUT`` or ``Pin.OUT``
        or ``True``, the clock is driven by the Ethernet controller, if set to ``LAN.IN``
        or ``Pin.IN`` or ``False``, the clock is driven by the PHY interface.

        Create a WLAN object, and optionally configure it. See `init()` for params of configuration.

        .. note::

        The ``WLAN`` constructor is special in the sense that if no arguments besides the id are given,
        it will return the already existing ``WLAN`` instance without re-configuring it. This is
        because ``WLAN`` is a system feature of the WiPy. If the already existing instance is not
        initialized it will do the same as the other constructors an will initialize it with default
        values.
