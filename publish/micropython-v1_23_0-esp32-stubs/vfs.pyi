Virtual filesystem control.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.23.0/library/vfs.html

The ``vfs`` module contains functions for creating filesystem objects and
mounting/unmounting them in the Virtual Filesystem.

Filesystem mounting
-------------------

Some ports provide a Virtual Filesystem (VFS) and the ability to mount multiple
"real" filesystems within this VFS.  Filesystem objects can be mounted at either
the root of the VFS, or at a subdirectory that lives in the root.  This allows
dynamic and flexible configuration of the filesystem that is seen by Python
programs.  Ports that have this functionality provide the :func:`mount` and
:func:`umount` functions, and possibly various filesystem implementations
represented by VFS classes.

    mount time and timestamps will only be added or updated if *mtime* is enabled,

    timestamps will work without reformatting and timestamps will be added
    transparently to existing files once they are opened for writing.  When *mtime*
    is enabled `os.stat` on files without timestamps will return 0 for the timestamp.
