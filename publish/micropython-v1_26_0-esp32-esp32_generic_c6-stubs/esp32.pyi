    Returns information about the ESP-IDF heap memory regions. One of them contains
    the MicroPython heap and the others are used by ESP-IDF, e.g., for network
    buffers and other data. This data is useful to get a sense of how much memory
    is available to ESP-IDF and the networking stack in particular. It may shed
    some light on situations where ESP-IDF operations fail due to allocation failures.

    The capabilities parameter corresponds to ESP-IDF's ``MALLOC_CAP_XXX`` values but the
    two most useful ones are predefined as `esp32.HEAP_DATA` for data heap regions and
    `esp32.HEAP_EXEC` for executable regions as used by the native code emitter.

    The return value is a list of 4-tuples, where each 4-tuple corresponds to one heap
    and contains: the total bytes, the free bytes, the largest free block, and
    the minimum free seen over time.

    Example after booting::

        >>> import esp32; esp32.idf_heap_info(esp32.HEAP_DATA)
        [(240, 0, 0, 0), (7288, 0, 0, 0), (16648, 4, 4, 4), (79912, 35712, 35512, 35108),
         (15072, 15036, 15036, 15036), (113840, 0, 0, 0)]

    ``Note:`` Free IDF heap memory in the `esp32.HEAP_DATA` region is available
       to be automatically added to the MicroPython heap to prevent a
       MicroPython allocation from failing. However, the information returned
       here is otherwise *not* useful to troubleshoot Python allocation
       failures. :func:`micropython.mem_info()` and :func:`gc.mem_free()` should
       be used instead:

       The "max new split" value in :func:`micropython.mem_info()` output
       corresponds to the largest free block of ESP-IDF heap that could be
       automatically added on demand to the MicroPython heap.

       The result of :func:`gc.mem_free()` is the total of the current "free"
       and "max new split" values printed by :func:`micropython.mem_info()`.

class RMT:
    """
    The RMT (Remote Control) module, specific to the ESP32, was originally designed
    to send and receive infrared remote control signals. However, due to a flexible
    design and very accurate (as low as 12.5ns) pulse generation, it can also be
    used to transmit or receive many other types of digital signals::

        import esp32
        from machine import Pin

        r = esp32.RMT(0, pin=Pin(18), clock_div=8)
        r  # RMT(channel=0, pin=18, source_freq=80000000, clock_div=8, idle_level=0)

        # To apply a carrier frequency to the high output
        r = esp32.RMT(0, pin=Pin(18), clock_div=8, tx_carrier=(38000, 50, 1))

        # The channel resolution is 100ns (1/(source_freq/clock_div)).
        r.write_pulses((1, 20, 2, 40), 0)  # Send 0 for 100ns, 1 for 2000ns, 0 for 200ns, 1 for 4000ns

    The input to the RMT module is an 80MHz clock (in the future it may be able to
    configure the input clock but, for now, it's fixed). ``clock_div`` *divides*
    the clock input which determines the resolution of the RMT channel. The
    numbers specified in ``write_pulses`` are multiplied by the resolution to
    define the pulses.

    ``clock_div`` is an 8-bit divider (0-255) and each pulse can be defined by
    multiplying the resolution by a 15-bit (0-32,768) number. There are eight
    channels (0-7) and each can have a different clock divider.

    So, in the example above, the 80MHz clock is divided by 8. Thus the
    resolution is (1/(80Mhz/8)) 100ns. Since the ``start`` level is 0 and toggles
    with each number, the bitstream is ``0101`` with durations of [100ns, 2000ns,
    100ns, 4000ns].

    .. Warning::
       The current MicroPython RMT implementation lacks some features, most notably
       receiving pulses. RMT should be considered a
       *beta feature* and the interface may change in the future.

          - ``rising``: an action to take on a rising edge - one of
            ``PCNT.INCREMENT``, ``PCNT.DECREMENT`` or ``PCNT.IGNORE`` (the default)
          - ``falling``: an action to take on a falling edge (takes the save values
            as the ``rising`` argument).

            altering the behaviour of the counter based on its level - set this
            keyword to any input Pin
          - ``mode_low``: set to either ``PCNT.HOLD`` or ``PCNT.REVERSE`` to
            either suspend counting or reverse the direction of the counter (i.e.,
            ``PCNT.INCREMENT`` behaves as ``PCNT.DECREMENT`` and vice versa)
            when ``mode_pin`` is low
          - ``mode_high``: as ``mode_low`` but for the behaviour when ``mode_pin``
            is high
          - ``filter``: set to a value 1..1023, in ticks of the 80MHz clock, to
            enable the pulse width filter
          - ``min``: set to the minimum level of the counter value when
            decrementing (-32768..-1) or 0 to disable
          - ``max``: set to the maximum level of the counter value when
            incrementing (1..32767) or 0 to disable
          - ``threshold0``: sets the counter value for the
            ``PCNT.IRQ_THRESHOLD0`` event (see ``irq`` method)
          - ``threshold1``: sets the counter value for the
            ``PCNT.IRQ_THRESHOLD1`` event (see ``irq`` method)
          - ``value``: can be set to ``0`` to reset the counter value

        The hardware initialisation is done in stages and so some of the keyword
        arguments can be used in groups or in isolation to partially reconfigure a
        unit:

          - the ``pin`` keyword (optionally combined with ``mode_pin``) can be used
            to change just the bound pin(s)
          - ``rising``, ``falling``, ``mode_low`` and ``mode_high`` can be used
            (singly or together) to change the counting logic - omitted keywords
            use their default (``PCNT.IGNORE`` or ``PCNT.NORMAL``)
          - ``filter`` can be used to change only the pulse width filter (with 0
            disabling it)
          - each of ``min``, ``max``, ``threshold0`` and ``threshold1`` can
            be used to change these limit/event values individually; however,
            setting any will reset the counter to zero (i.e., they imply
            ``value=0``)

        Each pulse counter unit supports two channels, 0 and 1, each able to
        monitor different pins with different counting logic but updating the same
        counter value. Use ``channel=1`` with the ``pin``, ``rising``, ``falling``,
        ``mode_pin``, ``mode_low`` and ``mode_high`` keywords to configure the
        second channel.

        The second channel can be used to configure 4X quadrature decoding with a
        single counter unit::

            pin_a = Pin(2, Pin.INPUT, pull=Pin.PULL_UP)
