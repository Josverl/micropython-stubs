    Translate the host/port argument into a sequence of 5-tuples that contain all the
    necessary arguments for creating a socket connected to that service. Arguments
    *af*, *type*, and *proto* (which have the same meaning as for the `socket()` function)
    can be used to filter which kind of addresses are returned. If a parameter is not
    specified or zero, all combinations of addresses can be returned (requiring
    filtering on the user side).

    The resulting list of 5-tuples has the following structure::

       (family, type, proto, canonname, sockaddr)

    The following example shows how to connect to a given url::

       # SOCK_STREAM will be returned, which may be not true

        Set a timeout on blocking socket operations. The value argument can be a nonnegative floating

        will raise an `OSError` exception if the timeout period value has elapsed before the operation has
        completed. If zero is given, the socket is put in non-blocking mode. If None is given, the socket
        is put in blocking mode.

        Not every :term:`MicroPython port` supports this method. A more portable and
        generic solution is to use `select.poll` object. This allows to wait on
        multiple objects at the same time (and not just on sockets, but on generic
        `stream` objects which support polling). Example::
