    Access the pin peripheral (GPIO pin) associated with the given ``id``.  If
    additional arguments are given in the constructor then they are used to initialise
    the pin.  Any settings that are not specified will remain in their previous state.

    The arguments are:

      - ``id`` is mandatory and can be an arbitrary object.  Among possible value
        types are: int (an internal Pin identifier), str (a Pin name), and tuple
        (pair of [port, pin]).

      - ``mode`` specifies the pin mode, which can be one of:

        - ``Pin.IN`` - Pin is configured for input.  If viewed as an output the pin
          is in high-impedance state.

        - ``Pin.OUT`` - Pin is configured for (normal) output.

        - ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` - Pin is configured for open-drain output. Open-drain
          output works in the following way: if the output value is set to 0 the pin
          is active at a low level; if the output value is 1 the pin is in a high-impedance
          state.  Not all ports implement this mode, or some might only on certain pins.

        - ``Pin.ALT`` - Pin is configured to perform an alternative function, which is
          port specific.  For a pin configured in such a way any other Pin methods
          (except :meth:`Pin.init`) are not applicable (calling them will lead to undefined,
          or a hardware-specific, result).  Not all ports implement this mode.

        - ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN`` - The Same as ``Pin.ALT``, but the pin is configured as
          open-drain.  Not all ports implement this mode.

        - ``Pin.ANALOG`` - Pin is configured for analog input, see the :class:`ADC` class.

      - ``pull`` specifies if the pin has a (weak) pull resistor attached, and can be
        one of:

        - ``None`` - No pull up or down resistor.
        - ``Pin.PULL_UP`` - Pull up resistor enabled.
        - ``Pin.PULL_DOWN`` - Pull down resistor enabled.

      - ``value`` is valid only for Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN modes and specifies initial
        output pin value if given, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains
        unchanged.

      - ``drive`` specifies the output power of the pin and can be one of: ``Pin.DRIVE_0``,
        ``Pin.DRIVE_1``, etc., increasing in drive strength.  The actual current driving
        capabilities are port dependent.  Not all ports implement this argument.

      - ``alt`` specifies an alternate function for the pin and the values it can take are
        port dependent.  This argument is valid only for ``Pin.ALT`` and ``Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN``
        modes.  It may be used when a pin supports more than one alternate function.  If only
        one pin alternate function is supported the this argument is not required.  Not all
        ports implement this argument.

    As specified above, the Pin class allows to set an alternate function for a particular
    pin, but it does not specify any further operations on such a pin.  Pins configured in
    alternate-function mode are usually not used as GPIO but are instead driven by other
    hardware peripherals.  The only operation supported on such a pin is re-initialising,
    by calling the constructor or :meth:`Pin.init` method.  If a pin that is configured in
    alternate-function mode is re-initialised with ``Pin.IN``, ``Pin.OUT``, or
    ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN``, the alternate function will be removed from the pin.

               ``Pin`` instance.

             - ``trigger`` configures the event which can generate an interrupt.
               Possible values are:

               - ``Pin.IRQ_FALLING`` interrupt on falling edge.
               - ``Pin.IRQ_RISING`` interrupt on rising edge.
               - ``Pin.IRQ_LOW_LEVEL`` interrupt on low level.
               - ``Pin.IRQ_HIGH_LEVEL`` interrupt on high level.

               These values can be OR'ed together to trigger on multiple events.

             - ``priority`` sets the priority level of the interrupt.  The values it
               can take are port-specific, but higher values always represent higher
               priorities.

             - ``wake`` selects the power mode in which this interrupt can wake up the
               system.  It can be ``machine.IDLE``, ``machine.SLEEP`` or ``machine.DEEPSLEEP``.
               These values can also be OR'ed together to make a pin generate interrupts in
               more than one power mode.

             - ``hard`` if true a hardware interrupt is used. This reduces the delay
               between the pin change and the handler being called. Hard interrupt
               handlers may not allocate memory; see :ref:`isr_rules`.

        the pin, returning 0 or 1 corresponding to low and high voltage signals
        respectively.  The behaviour of this method depends on the mode of the pin:

          - ``Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`` - If the value is '0' the pin is set to a low voltage
            state.  Otherwise the pin is set to high-impedance state.

        Initialise the SPI bus with the given parameters:

          - ``baudrate`` is the SCK clock rate.
          - ``polarity`` can be 0 or 1, and is the level the idle clock line sits at.
          - ``phase`` can be 0 or 1 to sample data on the first or second clock edge
            respectively.
          - ``bits`` is the width in bits of each transfer. Only 8 is guaranteed to be supported by all hardware.
          - ``firstbit`` can be ``SPI.MSB`` or ``SPI.LSB``.
          - ``sck``, ``mosi``, ``miso`` are pins (machine.Pin) objects to use for bus signals. For most
            hardware SPI blocks (as selected by ``id`` parameter to the constructor), pins are fixed
            and cannot be changed. In some cases, hardware blocks allow 2-3 alternative pin sets for
            a hardware SPI block. Arbitrary pin assignments are possible only for a bitbanging SPI driver
            (``id`` = -1).
          - ``pins`` - WiPy port doesn't ``sck``, ``mosi``, ``miso`` arguments, and instead allows to
            specify them as a tuple of ``pins`` parameter.

        In the case of hardware SPI the actual clock frequency may be lower than the
        requested baudrate. This is dependant on the platform hardware. The actual
        rate may be determined by printing the SPI object.

    * By wrapping existing Pin object - universal method which works for

    * By passing required Pin parameters directly to Signal constructor,
      skipping the need to create intermediate Pin object. Available on
      many, but not all boards.

    The arguments are:

      - ``pin_obj`` is existing Pin object.

      - ``pin_arguments`` are the same arguments as can be passed to Pin constructor.

      - ``invert`` - if True, the signal will be inverted (active low).

        This method allows to set and get the value of the signal, depending on whether

        signal is asserted (active) and 0 - signal inactive.

        If the argument is supplied then this method sets the signal level. The
        argument ``x`` can be anything that converts to a boolean. If it converts
        to ``True``, the signal is active, otherwise it is inactive.

        Correspondence between signal being active and actual logic level on the
        underlying pin depends on whether signal is inverted (active-low) or not.
        For non-inverted signal, active status corresponds to logical 1, inactive -
        to logical 0. For inverted/active-low signal, active status corresponds
        to logical 0, while inactive - to logical 1.
