This module allows to decompress binary data compressed with
`DEFLATE algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE>`_
(commonly used in zlib library and gzip archiver). Compression
is not yet implemented.

    Return decompressed *data* as bytes. *wbits* is DEFLATE dictionary window
    size used during compression (8-15, the dictionary size is power of 2 of
    that value). Additionally, if value is positive, *data* is assumed to be
    zlib stream (with zlib header). Otherwise, if it's negative, it's assumed
    to be raw DEFLATE stream. *bufsize* parameter is for compatibility with

    Create a `stream` wrapper which allows transparent decompression of

    streams with data larger than available heap size. In addition to
    values described in :func:`decompress`, *wbits* may take values
    24..31 (16 + 8..15), meaning that input stream has gzip header.
