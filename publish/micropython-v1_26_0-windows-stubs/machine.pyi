Functions related to the hardware.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.26.0/library/machine.html

The ``machine`` module contains specific functions related to the hardware
on a particular board. Most functions in this module allow to achieve direct
and unrestricted access to and control of hardware blocks on a system
(like CPU, timers, buses, etc.). Used incorrectly, this can lead to
malfunction, lockups, crashes of your board, and in extreme cases, hardware
damage.

class Signal(Pin):
    """
    The Signal class is a simple extension of the `Pin` class. Unlike Pin, which
    can be only in "absolute" 0 and 1 states, a Signal can be in "asserted"
    (on) or "deasserted" (off) states, while being inverted (active-low) or
    not. In other words, it adds logical inversion support to Pin functionality.
    While this may seem a simple addition, it is exactly what is needed to
    support wide array of simple digital devices in a way portable across
    different boards, which is one of the major MicroPython goals. Regardless
    of whether different users have an active-high or active-low LED, a normally
    open or normally closed relay - you can develop a single, nicely looking
    application which works with each of them, and capture hardware
    configuration differences in few lines in the config file of your app.

    Example::

        from machine import Pin, Signal

        # Suppose you have an active-high LED on pin 0
        led1_pin = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)
        # ... and active-low LED on pin 1
        led2_pin = Pin(1, Pin.OUT)

        # Now to light up both of them using Pin class, you'll need to set
        # them to different values
        led1_pin.value(1)
        led2_pin.value(0)

        # Signal class allows to abstract away active-high/active-low
        # difference
        led1 = Signal(led1_pin, invert=False)
        led2 = Signal(led2_pin, invert=True)

        # Now lighting up them looks the same
        led1.value(1)
        led2.value(1)

        # Even better:
        led1.on()
        led2.on()

    Following is the guide when Signal vs Pin should be used:

    * Use Signal: If you want to control a simple on/off (including software
      PWM!) devices like LEDs, multi-segment indicators, relays, buzzers, or
      read simple binary sensors, like normally open or normally closed buttons,
      pulled high or low, Reed switches, moisture/flame detectors, etc. etc.
      Summing up, if you have a real physical device/sensor requiring GPIO
      access, you likely should use a Signal.

    * Use Pin: If you implement a higher-level protocol or bus to communicate
      with more complex devices.

    The split between Pin and Signal come from the use cases above and the
    architecture of MicroPython: Pin offers the lowest overhead, which may
    be important when bit-banging protocols. But Signal adds additional
    flexibility on top of Pin, at the cost of minor overhead (much smaller
    than if you implemented active-high vs active-low device differences in
    Python manually!). Also, Pin is a low-level object which needs to be
    implemented for each support board, while Signal is a high-level object
    which comes for free once Pin is implemented.

    If in doubt, give the Signal a try! Once again, it is offered to save
    developers from the need to handle unexciting differences like active-low
    vs active-high signals, and allow other users to share and enjoy your
    application, instead of being frustrated by the fact that it doesn't
    work for them simply because their LEDs or relays are wired in a slightly
    different way.
