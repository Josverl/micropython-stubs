Functionality specific to the RP2.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.21.0/library/rp2.html

The ``rp2`` module contains functions and classes specific to the RP2040, as
used in the Raspberry Pi Pico.

See the `RP2040 Python datasheet
<https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf>`_
for more information, and `pico-micropython-examples

          the system clock frequency.

          at the default system clock frequency of 125MHz, the minimum value of
          *freq* is ``1908``. To run state machines at slower frequencies, you'll
          need to reduce the system clock speed with `machine.freq()`.
