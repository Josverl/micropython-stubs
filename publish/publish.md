# Publication script : 

It is to be preferred to use stubber to publish the stubs, but if you need to publish the stubs manually, you can use the following steps.

``` bash
python .\publish\publish_stubs.py  --help

-p, --port [stm32|esp32|esp8266|rp2]
                                  multiple:   [default: stm32, esp32, esp8266,
                                  rp2]
  -b, --board [GENERIC]           multiple:   [default: GENERIC]
  --pypi / --test-pypi            publish to PYPI or Test-PYPI
  --dry-run                       go though the motions but do not publish
  --force                         create new post release even if no changes
                                  detected
  --clean                         clean folders after processing and
                                  publishing
  -v, --verbose
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

```

   - get token from https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - store token using `poetry config pypi-token.test-pypi  pypi-YYYYYYYY`
   Note: 'test-pypi' is the name of the repository

### PYPI Production

   - store token using `poetry config pypi-token.pypi pypi-XXXXXXXX`
