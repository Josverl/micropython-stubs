    Schedule the function *func* to be executed "very soon".  The function
    is passed the value *arg* as its single argument.  "Very soon" means that
    the MicroPython runtime will do its best to execute the function at the
    earliest possible time, given that it is also trying to be efficient, and
    that the following conditions hold:

    - A scheduled function will never preempt another scheduled function.
    - Scheduled functions are always executed "between opcodes" which means
      that all fundamental Python operations (such as appending to a list)
      are guaranteed to be atomic.
    - A given port may define "critical regions" within which scheduled
      functions will never be executed.  Functions may be scheduled within
      a critical region but they will not be executed until that region
      is exited.  An example of a critical region is a preempting interrupt
      handler (an IRQ).

    A use for this function is to schedule a callback from a preempting IRQ.
    Such an IRQ puts restrictions on the code that runs in the IRQ (for example
    the heap may be locked) and scheduling a function to call later will lift
    those restrictions.

    On multi-threaded ports, the scheduled function's behaviour depends on
    whether the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is enabled for the specific port:

    - If GIL is enabled, the function can preempt any thread and run in its
      context.
    - If GIL is disabled, the function will only preempt the main thread and run
      in its context.

    Note: If `schedule()` is called from a preempting IRQ, when memory
    allocation is not allowed and the callback to be passed to `schedule()` is
    a bound method, passing this directly will fail. This is because creating a
    reference to a bound method causes memory allocation. A solution is to
    create a reference to the method in the class constructor and to pass that
    reference to `schedule()`. This is discussed in detail here
    :ref:`reference documentation <isr_rules>` under "Creation of Python
    objects".

    There is a finite queue to hold the scheduled functions and `schedule()`
    will raise a `RuntimeError` if the queue is full.
