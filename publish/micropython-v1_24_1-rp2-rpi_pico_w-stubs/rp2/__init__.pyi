Functionality specific to the RP2.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.24.0/library/rp2.html

The ``rp2`` module contains functions and classes specific to the RP2040, as
used in the Raspberry Pi Pico.

See the `RP2040 Python datasheet
<https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf>`_
for more information, and `pico-micropython-examples
<https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-micropython-examples/tree/master/pio>`_
for example code.

Module: 'rp2.PIOASMEmit'

---
This module provides type hints for the `rp2.asm_pio` module in the Raspberry Pi Pico Python SDK.
It includes definitions for constants, functions, and directives used in PIO assembly programming.

The module includes docstrings for each function and directive, providing information on their usage and parameters.

Note: This module is intended for use with type checking and does not contain actual implementations of the functions.

For more information on PIO assembly programming and the Raspberry Pi Pico Python SDK, refer to the following documents:
- raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf
- raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf

rp2.PIO type hints have to be loaded manually. Add the following lines to the top of the file with the PIO assembler code:

    of `PIO.IN_LOW`, `PIO.IN_HIGH`, `PIO.OUT_LOW` or `PIO.OUT_HIGH`. If the
    program uses more than one pin, provide a tuple, e.g.
    ``out_init=(PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW)``.

    - *out_init* configures the pins used for ``out()`` instructions.
    - *set_init* configures the pins used for ``set()`` instructions. There can
      be at most 5.
    - *sideset_init* configures the pins used side-setting. There can be at
      most 5.

    The following parameters are used by default, but can be overridden in
    `StateMachine.init()`:

    - *in_shiftdir* is the default direction the ISR will shift, either
      `PIO.SHIFT_LEFT` or `PIO.SHIFT_RIGHT`.
    - *out_shiftdir* is the default direction the OSR will shift, either
      `PIO.SHIFT_LEFT` or `PIO.SHIFT_RIGHT`.
    - *push_thresh* is the threshold in bits before auto-push or conditional
      re-pushing is triggered.
    - *pull_thresh* is the threshold in bits before auto-pull or conditional
      re-pulling is triggered.

    The remaining parameters are:

    - *autopush* configures whether auto-push is enabled.
    - *autopull* configures whether auto-pull is enabled.
    - *fifo_join* configures whether the 4-word TX and RX FIFOs should be
      combined into a single 8-word FIFO for one direction only. The options

        If automatic push is enabled, IN will also push the ISR contents to the RX FIFO if the push threshold is reached
        (SHIFTCTRL_PUSH_THRESH). IN still executes in one cycle, whether an automatic push takes place or not. The state machine
        will stall if the RX FIFO is full when an automatic push occurs. An automatic push clears the ISR contents to all-zeroes,
        and clears the input shift count.
        IN always uses the least significant Bit count bits of the source data. For example, if PINCTRL_IN_BASE is set to 5, the
        instruction IN PINS, 3 will take the values of pins 5, 6 and 7, and shift these into the ISR. First the ISR is shifted to the left
        or right to make room for the new input data, then the input data is copied into the gap this leaves. The bit order of the
        input data is not dependent on the shift direction.
        NULL can be used for shifting the ISR’s contents. For example, UARTs receive the LSB first, so must shift to the right.
        After 8 IN PINS, 1 instructions, the input serial data will occupy bits 31…24 of the ISR. An IN NULL, 24 instruction will shift
        in 24 zero bits, aligning the input data at ISR bits 7…0. Alternatively, the processor or DMA could perform a byte read
        from FIFO address + 3, which would take bits 31…24 of the FIFO contents.

        value is the least significant Bit count bits of the OSR if SHIFTCTRL_OUT_SHIFTDIR is to the right, otherwise it is the most
        significant bits.

        PINS and PINDIRS use the OUT pin mapping.

        If automatic pull is enabled, the OSR is automatically refilled from the TX FIFO if the pull threshold, SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH,
        is reached. The output shift count is simultaneously cleared to 0. In this case, the OUT will stall if the TX FIFO is empty,
        but otherwise still executes in one cycle.

        OUT EXEC allows instructions to be included inline in the FIFO datastream. The OUT itself executes on one cycle, and the
        instruction from the OSR is executed on the next cycle. There are no restrictions on the types of instructions which can
        be executed by this mechanism. Delay cycles on the initial OUT are ignored, but the executee may insert delay cycles as
        normal.

        `JMP PIN` branches on the GPIO selected by EXECCTRL_JMP_PIN, a configuration field which selects one out of the maximum

        `!OSRE` compares the bits shifted out since the last PULL with the shift count threshold configured by SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH.

                01: PIN: Input pin selected by Index. This state machine’s input IO mapping is applied first, and then Index
            selects which of the mapped bits to wait on. In other words, the pin is selected by adding Index to the

        WAIT x IRQ behaves slightly differently from other WAIT sources:
        * If Polarity is 1, the selected IRQ flag is cleared by the state machine upon the wait condition being met.
        * The flag index is decoded in the same way as the IRQ index field: if the MSB is set, the state machine ID (0…3) is
        added to the IRQ index, by way of modulo-4 addition on the two LSBs. For example, state machine 2 with a flag
        value of '0x11' will wait on flag 3, and a flag value of '0x13' will wait on flag 1. This allows multiple state machines
        running the same program to synchronise with each other.

        * IfEmpty: If 1, do nothing unless the total output shift count has reached its threshold, SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH (the
        same as for autopull).
        * Block: If 1, stall if TX FIFO is empty. If 0, pulling from an empty FIFO copies scratch X to OSR.

        Some peripherals (UART, SPI…) should halt when no data is available, and pick it up as it comes in; others (I2S) should
        clock continuously, and it is better to output placeholder or repeated data than to stop clocking. This can be achieved
        with the Block parameter.
        A nonblocking PULL on an empty FIFO has the same effect as MOV OSR, X. The program can either preload scratch register
        X with a suitable default, or execute a MOV X, OSR after each PULL NOBLOCK, so that the last valid FIFO word will be recycled
        until new data is available.

        PULL IFEMPTY is useful if an OUT with autopull would stall in an inappropriate location when the TX FIFO is empty. For
        example, a UART transmitter should not stall immediately after asserting the start bit. IfEmpty permits some of the same
        program simplifications as autopull, but the stall occurs at a controlled point in the program.

        NOTE:
        When autopull is enabled, any PULL instruction is a no-op when the OSR is full, so that the PULL instruction behaves as
        a barrier. OUT NULL, 32 can be used to explicitly discard the OSR contents. See the RP2040 Datasheet for more detail
        on autopull

        - *inc_read*: ``bool`` Increment the read address after each transfer (default: ``True``).

        - *inc_write*: ``bool`` Increment the write address after each transfer (default: ``True``).

          disables address wrapping.

          or ``True`` to apply to the write address.

          completes. Setting this value to this DMA object's own channel number
          disables chaining (this is the default).

          datasheet for details.

        - *irq_quiet*: ``bool`` Do not generate interrupt at the end of each transfer. Interrupts
          will instead be generated when a zero value is written to the trigger
          register, which will halt a sequence of chained transfers (default:
          ``True``).

        - *bswap*: ``bool`` If set to true, bytes in words or half-words will be reversed before
          writing (default: ``True``).

        - *sniff_en*: ``bool`` Set to ``True`` to allow data to be accessed by the chips sniff
          hardware (default: ``False``).
