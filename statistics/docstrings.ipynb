      "('bluetooth.__init__', 'irq', '\\n            Registers a callback for events from the BLE stack. The *handler* takes two\\n            arguments, ``event`` (which will be one of the codes below) and ``data``\\n            (which is an event-specific tuple of values).\\n\\n            **Note:** As an optimisation to prevent unnecessary allocations, the ``addr``,\\n            ``adv_data``, ``char_data``, ``notify_data``, and ``uuid`` entries in the\\n            tuples are read-only memoryview instances pointing to :mod:`bluetooth`\\'s internal\\n            ringbuffer, and are only valid during the invocation of the IRQ handler\\n            function.  If your program needs to save one of these values to access after\\n            the IRQ handler has returned (e.g. by saving it in a class instance or global\\n            variable), then it needs to take a copy of the data, either by using ``bytes()``\\n            or ``bluetooth.UUID()``, like this::\\n\\n                connected_addr = bytes(addr)  # equivalently: adv_data, char_data, or notify_data\\n                matched_uuid = bluetooth.UUID(uuid)\\n\\n            For example, the IRQ handler for a scan result might inspect the ``adv_data``\\n            to decide if it\\'s the correct device, and only then copy the address data to be\\n            used elsewhere in the program.
