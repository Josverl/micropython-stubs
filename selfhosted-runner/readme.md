# Self hosted runner on linux X64 / ARM64

This is a guide to setup a self hosted runner on a linux X64 / ARM64 machine. 
The guide is based on the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners) 
and my own experience setting up a runner on a Raspberry Pi 4 and x64 using Ubuntu 22.04.

## install system wide software

```bash
sudo apt update
# python & friends
sudo apt install python3.11 python3-venv python3-pip pipx
.local/bin/pipx ensurepath

# pwsh is needed for some scripts in workflows
sudo snap install powershell --classic

# disk mount
# pmount - mount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal user
# needed by mpflash to mount UF2 devices
sudo apt install pmount

# more python tools via pipx
pipx install poetry     # to install stuff 
pipx install mpremote   # to control the USB Relay
```


## create a separate user for the runner

Create a user `runner` that is member of the dialout and sudo groups

```bash
# create user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash runner
# add to sudo group
sudo uexitermod -a -G sudo runner
# add to dialout group - access to comports
sudo usermod -a -G dialout runner
# access to pmount
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev runner
# change to user
su - runner
```

## allow the runner to run sudo commands

In order to allow the runner to run sudo commands without a password, add the following line to a file in the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory.

```bash
# needed to allow deadsnakes/action to install python
echo "runner ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/add-apt-repository, /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/apt install" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/runner

echo "jos ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/add-apt-repository, /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/apt install" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/jos
```


### STM32 - not needed anymore

The STM32 Cube Programmer CLI - X64 only
needed to flash STM32 devices
See : https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html
install on linux x64

```bash
sudo apt install libusb-1.0.0-dev
```

STP32 udev rules are required to allow the runner to access the STM32 devices.
Files to copy to /etc/udev/rules.d/ on Ubuntu ("sudo cp ./udev-rules/*.* /etc/udev/rules.d").

Reload the rules with
`sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger`

### ### Install Github Actions runner

This installs the runner in the home directory of the runner user.
In this example a runner with `Repository` scope  is created. 

- Install self hosted runner : 
  [Adding self-hosted runners - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-a-repository)

- Configure environment 
  
  > `.../actions_runner/.env`
  > Copy the .env and usbhub_off_on.sh files to the runner's home directory

- testrun  
    `./run.sh`

- configure to run as a service  
    `sudo ./svc.sh install`

- start service  
  `sudo ./svc.sh start`

# known issues

### actions/setup-python does not support linux-arm64

The `actions/setup-python` action does not support installing/configuring Python on linux-arm64.

The workaround is to use the `deadsnakes/action` action to install python.
https://github.com/deadsnakes/action?tab=readme-ov-file#deadsnakesaction

see:  https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/172/files#diff-e0c5149ab771083cacddbeaf3336656118f582f6311228e0b8652c3209a7dd2eR32-R39

```yaml
### esp8266 devices not recognized 
By default the brltty service is running and it blocks the usb port used by an esp8266.

the below log shows the service blocking the port
```bash
$ sudo dmesg | tail
[981998.822746] usb 1-2.1.1: new full-speed USB device number 67 using xhci_hcd
[981998.924954] usb 1-2.1.1: New USB device found, idVendor=1a86, idProduct=7523, bcdDevice= 2.64
[981998.924971] usb 1-2.1.1: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
[981998.924978] usb 1-2.1.1: Product: USB Serial
[981998.928861] ch341 1-2.1.1:1.0: ch341-uart converter detected
[981998.929906] usb 1-2.1.1: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0
[981999.500370] input: BRLTTY 6.4 Linux Screen Driver Keyboard as /devices/virtual/input/input49
[981999.503750] usb 1-2.1.1: usbfs: interface 0 claimed by ch341 while 'brltty' sets config #1
[981999.504577] ch341-uart ttyUSB0: ch341-uart convert
```

You should remove the service with the following command

```
sudo apt remove brltty
```

Test by connecting an esp8266 and checking visibility using `mpremote devs`

```bash
$ sudo dmesg | tail
[981999.503750] usb 1-2.1.1: usbfs: interface 0 claimed by ch341 while 'brltty' sets config #1
[981999.504577] ch341-uart ttyUSB0: ch341-uart converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0

$ mpremote devs

# Note- its simpler to build these targets in a container

# local Build requirements

If you want to build unix / windows / webassembly targets you need to install the following packages
avoid apt install to ask for confirmation
I assume the same is set on GH hosted runners

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90_assume_yes
APT::Get::Assume-Yes "true";

$ cat /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90_assume_yes
```

ref : https://superuser.com/questions/164553/automatically-answer-yes-when-using-apt-get-install

## Build unix using ci scripts

```bash
# requirements
sudo apt install -y build-essential libffi-dev pkg-config
# clean
make -C ports/unix clean
# build unix
source tools/ci.sh && ci_unix_standard_build
# copy build-standard/micropython to the runner user's home directory
mkdir -p ~/builds/unix
cp ports/unix/build-standard/micropython ~/builds/unix/micropython
```

# build webassembly

```bash
# requirements
source tools/ci.sh && ci_webassembly_setup
# clean
make -C ports/webassembly clean
# build webassembly
source tools/ci.sh && ci_webassembly_build
# copy 
mkdir -p ~/builds/webassembly
cp ports/webassembly/build/*.wasm ~/builds/webassembly/
cp ports/webassembly/build/*.js ~/builds/webassembly/
```

## build windows

Note: The Windows port's dependencies are not installed silently and need `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90_assume_yes`
to suppress the confirmation prompt.

```bash
# requirements
source tools/ci.sh && ci_windows_setup
# clean
make -C ports/windows clean
# build windows on linux
source tools/ci.sh && ci_windows_build
# copy 
mkdir -p ~/builds/windows
cp ports/windows/build-standard/*.exe ~/builds/windows/
```
