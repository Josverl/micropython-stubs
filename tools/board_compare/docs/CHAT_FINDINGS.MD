# CHAT_FINDINGS.MD – MicroPython & PyScript Agent Difficulty Analysis

Date: 2025-10-23
Scope: Conversation series 001–008 (+ Untitled-1) covering optimization, refactoring, database build, frontend event migration, and tooling.

## 1. Executive Summary
The agent’s largest friction points clustered around frontend event migration (mpy-click), performance caching design (IndexedDB + SQL.js), runtime/module configuration (pyscript.toml vs inline imports), and disciplined modular refactoring. Diagnostic depth for certain errors (notably the Search tab’s “Error 3170”) lagged behind other areas. Many issues stemmed from mixing mental models of CPython, browser JS, and MicroPython-in-PyScript.

Top 5 Critical Improvement Targets:
1. mpy-click Event Model: Misuse of argument passing & delayed pivot to data-* attribute strategy.
2. SQL.js / IndexedDB Caching: Repeated initialization, aggressive invalidation, version mismatch confusion.
3. PyScript Module Configuration: Unclear boundary between pyscript.toml module registration vs dynamic imports causing import failures.
4. Modular Refactor Discipline: Scope creep, partial extraction without cleanup; risk of exceeding module cap or duplicating logic.
5. Search Tab Error Diagnosis: Symptom treated superficially (UI rendering) without isolating underlying data flow.

## 3. Detailed Findings
### 3.1 mpy-click Event Handling
Symptoms:
- Attempts to call handlers with arguments directly (e.g., mpy-click="toggle_tree_node('mod','cls')").
- Wrapper functions missing event parameter; later retrofitted (event=None).
- Fallback to JavaScript-like inline patterns before adopting data-* attribute approach.

Representative Examples:
- Early toggleModule/toggleClass reliance; migration channeled through wrapper without simplifying argument model.
- Event handlers defined in a module that is not directly imported in the HTML script tag remain invisible to mpy-click.

Root Cause:
- Initial assumption that mpy-click mirrors JS onclick signature flexibility.

Impact:
- Non-firing handlers, mis-targeted expansions, increased debugging overhead.

Recommendations:
- Enforce rule: mpy-click handlers MUST be zero-arg Python callables; pass context via data-* attributes only.
- Standard wrapper signature: def handler(event=None): ...
- Provide helper: get_dataset(element, keys: list[str]) → dict for attribute extraction.
- Event handlers defined in sub-modules must be visible / imported in the main module.

Instruction Additions:
- “Never embed arguments in mpy-click attributes; use data-* + shared handler.”
- “Always provide default event=None to avoid PyScript arity mismatch.”

### 3.2 SQL.js + IndexedDB Caching Lifecycle
Symptoms:
- Duplicate initSqlJs() calls; long first-load (>40s) despite caching intent.
- Cache invalidation via unconditional re-fetch; version mismatch (IndexedDB v1 vs in-code v2).
- HEAD fallback logic initially broken (always fetching full file).

Root Cause:
- Blended patterns from generic JS examples without consolidating initialization state.
Impact:
- Massive performance overhead; user frustration; delayed feature verification.

Recommendations:
- Single initialization contract: initialize_sqljs() returns reused instance.
- Cache metadata schema: {version, etag, last_modified, size, created_at}.
- Validation order: (version change) OR (etag mismatch) OR (last_modified newer) → re-fetch; else open from cache.

Instruction Additions:
- “Never re-run initSqlJs after successful first instance—store and reuse.”
- “HEAD check must short-circuit on identical ETag before downloading.”

### 3.3 PyScript Module Configuration
Symptoms:
- Import errors for sqlite_wasm / database layer; confusion whether html <py-script> or pyscript.toml needs adjustment.

Root Cause:
- Unclear mental separation of ‘declared modules’ vs runtime dynamic imports.

Impact:
- Broken app startup; cascading event handler failures.

Recommendations:
- Explicit checklist: (1) Add file path to pyscript.toml modules array; (2) Confirm relative path accuracy; (3) Use stable import names—no conditional renames mid-refactor.

Instruction Additions:
- “Before refactoring imports, verify pyscript.toml alignment—run quick import smoke test.”

### 3.4 Modular Refactor Discipline
Symptoms:
- Partial extraction (database.py, ui.py) with residual logic in main.py.
- Risk of exceeding planned ≤6 modules; repeated function relocation.

Root Cause:
- Opportunistic migration without consolidation passes.

Impact:
- Maintenance complexity; higher coupling during interim states; search error deferred.

Recommendations:
- Two-phase approach: Extract + Immediate purge of old code paths.
- Module Responsibility Charter: database.py (data access), ui.py (DOM/template), explorer.py (navigation & page assembly), compare.py (board diff), search.py (queries + presentation), main.py (bootstrap & routing only).

Instruction Additions:
- “After creating a new module, remove or mark deprecated code in source file within same session.”

### 3.5 Search Tab “Error 3170” Diagnosis
Symptoms:
- Error message displayed; underlying queries succeed (counts log positive).

Root Cause:
- UI render pipeline issue—probably transformation from results → DOM elements failing silently before error placeholder triggers.

Impact:
- Feature perceived broken; deferred fix accumulating technical debt.

Recommendations:
- Introduce minimal diagnostic wrapper: trace("search-stage", stage_name, meta) with throttle.
- Add test harness simulate_search("Pin") verifying progression: input → query → result list length → DOM injection.

Instruction Additions:
- “Treat displayed errors as UI pipeline issues unless DB query clearly fails.”

### 3.6 MicroPython vs CPython FFI Nuances
Symptoms:
- getattr(dataset, 'moduleTarget') vs direct dictionary access confusion; incorrect attribute extraction.

Root Cause:
- MicroPython object proxy differences under PyScript; assuming CPython attribute semantics.

Impact:
- Null targets; failure to expand modules/classes.

Recommendations:
- Use dataset = event.target.dataset; module = dataset.get('moduleTarget') pattern (or MicroPython adaptation wrapper).

Instruction Additions:
- “Always normalize dataset extraction through a dedicated helper for cross-runtime safety.”

### 3.7 Version & Schema Evolution
Symptoms:
- Confusion over separate --stdlib-version flag; later unified.
- Adding package_name/package_version columns via ALTER TABLE after initial schema.

Root Cause:
- Organic schema growth w/o upfront migration plan.

Impact:
- Potential mismatch in downstream consumers; fragile upgrade path.

Recommendations:
- Migration ledger: migrations/001_add_package_info.sql (document steps) even if executed dynamically.

Instruction Additions:
- “When extending schema, log migration intent in /docs/qa_testing.md or migrations ledger.”

### 3.8 Async vs Sync Handler Mismatch
Symptoms:
- retry_comparison wrapper needed to encapsulate async compare; initial direct call attempts.

Root Cause:
- Overlooking requirement that mpy-click invokes sync callable returning immediately.

Impact:
- Unawaited coroutines; silent failures.

Recommendations:
- Pattern: def retry_comparison(event=None): asyncio.create_task(do_compare()).

Instruction Additions:
- “Wrap all async flows triggered by mpy-click in a sync launcher using asyncio.create_task.”

### 3.9 Template data-* Mapping Confusion
Symptoms:
- Mixed naming: data-module-target vs dataset.moduleTarget; inconsistent camel/slug forms.

Root Cause:
- Inconsistent transformation logic in populate_template().

Impact:
- event handler missing expected attribute names.

Recommendations:
- Canonical form: HTML attribute data-module-target → dataset.moduleTarget; automated conversion hyphen → camelCase after first hyphen.

Instruction Additions:
- “Adopt consistent data-* naming: data-class-target / data-module-target only.”

### 3.10 Tooling & Environment Misuse
Symptoms:
- Considering SQLite CLI for queries (not installed); POSIX commands on Windows shell.

Root Cause:
- Carryover from generic Python/Unix workflows.

Impact:
- Wasted cycles; need for user correction.

Recommendations:
- Default data queries through provided Data Store tools or JSON (all_modules.json).

Instruction Additions:
- “Avoid assuming presence of system utilities; check tool availability first.”

### 3.11 Multi-Tab Regression Oversight
Symptoms:
- Focus on Explorer tab after changes; late validation of Compare/Search.

Root Cause:
- Single-path testing bias.

Impact:
- Latent errors discovered late; compounding debugging complexity.

Recommendations:
- Mandatory tri-tab smoke test after each DB/event change (Explorer: load modules; Compare: diff two boards; Search: sample query).

Instruction Additions:
- “Post-change checklist: run tri-tab smoke sequence before next refactor.”

### 3.12 Documentation Synchronization
Symptoms:
- Docs and instructions updated post-change with brief lag; potential mismatch for new contributors.

Root Cause:
- Docs treated as afterthought.

Impact:
- Onboarding friction.

Recommendations:
- “Doc Delta” section appended to ARCHITECTURE.md per sprint summarizing adjustments.

Instruction Additions:
- “Bundle code + doc update in same session for architectural changes.”

### 3.13 Naming / Consistency
Symptoms:
- Mixed version formats (v1.24.1 vs v1_24_1) contextually correct but occasionally swapped.

Root Cause:
- Cognitive load of dual naming convention.

Impact:
- Minor confusion, risk of path mismatch.

Recommendations:
- Utility: normalize_version_display(raw) → tuple(flat, dotted) and always derive rather than manual typing.

Instruction Additions:
- “Never manually convert version formats—use helper.”

## 4. Cross-Cutting Recommendations
- Establish “Refactor Gate” criteria: performance stable, tests green, tri-tab verified before next extraction.
- Introduce lightweight structured logging categories: PERF, EVENT, DB, UI with max 1 line per category per stage.
- Provide standardized helper library (utils_frontend.py) with dataset + async wrappers to eliminate repetition.
- Short daily snapshot note (CHANGELOG_DEV.md) to reduce archaeology.

## 5. Agent Instruction Update Checklist (Draft for Integration)
1. mpy-click usage: zero-arg handlers, data-* driven context, event=None signature.
2. Async invocation: wrap coroutine creation in sync wrapper with asyncio.create_task.
3. SQL.js: single initialization; cache validation order (version → etag → last-modified).
4. Module additions: update pyscript.toml then import smoke test.
5. Tri-tab smoke test after each change.
6. Dataset access via helper (avoid direct getattr chain confusion).
7. Schema evolution: record migration intent + update docs same session.
8. Version format: always use normalized helper.
9. Search debugging: stage-by-stage trace before UI error placeholder.
10. Prefer Data Store / JSON over absent system tools.

## 6. Correct vs Incorrect Patterns
| Concern | Incorrect | Correct |
|---------|----------|---------|
| mpy-click args | mpy-click="toggle_tree_node('m','c')" | data-module-target="mod" data-class-target="cls" mpy-click="toggle_tree_node" |
| Async event | mpy-click="compare_boards" (async def) | def retry_comparison(...): asyncio.create_task(compare_boards()) |
| SQL.js init | initSqlJs(); initSqlJs(); | sql = initSqlJs(); reuse sql |
| Cache validation | Always fetch full DB | HEAD → compare ETag → skip download |
| Module import | Import before pyscript.toml entry | Add to toml modules → import & test |
| Version format | Manual string replace | flat, dotted = normalize_version_display(raw) |
| Dataset access | getattr(event.target.dataset,'moduleTarget') w/o guard | ds = get_dataset(event.target, ['moduleTarget']); |

## 7. Deferred / Secondary Issues
- Search error root fix (UI pipeline) pending dedicated triage session.
- Full module isolation (explorer.py, compare.py, search.py) incomplete; recommended phased extraction.
- Logging noise reduction (current timing prints) not yet standardized.

## 8. Proposed Next Steps
1. Implement helper utilities (dataset, async launcher, version normalization).
2. Complete module separation + purge redundant code in main.py.
3. Add minimal search pipeline diagnostics & resolve Error 3170.
4. Integrate instruction checklist into .github/copilot-instructions.md.
5. Create CHANGELOG_DEV.md for incremental architectural notes.

## 9. Quality Gate Notes
- Performance gate now met (Option 4 cached path ~millisecond scale).
- Event model stabilized post-mpy-click migration.
- Remaining risk: Search tab rendering and lingering mixed responsibilities in main.py.

## 10. Summary
The challenges predominantly arose from applying non-MicroPython paradigms directly in a hybrid PyScript context—particularly for events, caching, and module imports. Addressing these through explicit patterns (data-* + zero-arg handlers, single SQL.js lifecycle, structured tri-tab tests) and helper abstractions will materially reduce future friction. A concise instruction augmentation plus low-cost utilities should eliminate repeat mistakes and accelerate subsequent refactors.
