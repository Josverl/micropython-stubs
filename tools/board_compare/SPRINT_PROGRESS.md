# Sprint Progress Tracker

## Current Sprint: Sprint 2 - Search Optimization (Highest ROI)

**Status**: üü° In Progress - Testing Required  
**Started**: 2025-10-23  
**Target Completion**: TBD

### Sprint 2 Goals
- Replace 6 search queries with 1 unified view query in `search.py`
- Maintain identical UX (no user-visible changes)
- **Validate with Playwright MCP tests** (CRITICAL - frontend was modified)
- Measure performance improvement

### Sprint 2 Tasks

- [x] **Task 2.1**: Refactor `perform_search()` function
  - Status: ‚úÖ Complete
  - File: `tools/board_compare/frontend/search.py`
  - Action: Replace 6 entity-specific queries with single `v_board_entities` query
  - Result: Reduced from ~250 lines to ~60 lines (76% reduction); single unified query

- [x] **Task 2.2**: Update search result processing
  - Status: ‚úÖ Complete (No changes needed)
  - File: `tools/board_compare/frontend/search.py`
  - Action: Verified result processing compatible with unified view schema
  - Result: View provides same result structure as original queries

- [x] **Task 2.4**: Performance validation
  - Status: ‚úÖ Complete
  - File: `tests/board_compare/benchmark_search.py`
  - Action: Measure search latency before/after view adoption
  - Result: Performance competitive (sometimes faster, view found more complete results)

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Playwright MCP test - search functionality (CRITICAL)
  - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress - Testing Required
  - File: `tests/board_compare/test_search_with_views.py`
  - Action: Automated UI test of search with real queries
  - **BLOCKER**: Frontend code changed, must validate before sprint completion

### Sprint 2 Exit Criteria
- ‚úÖ Search uses `v_board_entities` view
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **All search functionality works (NEEDS PLAYWRIGHT TESTING)**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Playwright tests pass (CRITICAL - IN PROGRESS)**
- ‚úÖ Search performance validated (competitive, sometimes faster)
- ‚úÖ Code complexity reduced (76% reduction, clearer logic)
