# Sprint Progress Tracker

## Current Sprint: Sprint 3 - Loading Optimization ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Started**: 2025-10-23  
**Completed**: 2025-10-23  
**Time**: ~2 hours

### Sprint 3 Summary
Successfully refactored module loading to eliminate N+1 query problem, achieving 99.5% query reduction. Comprehensive testing across three different board architectures confirmed functionality.

### Sprint 3 Tasks - All Complete

- [x] **Task 3.1**: Refactor `get_board_modules()` to use bulk queries ✅
  - Status: ✅ Complete - Fully tested
  - File: `tools/board_compare/frontend/database.py`
  - Changes:
    - Replaced N+1 query pattern with 6 bulk queries
    - Query 1: All modules (v_board_modules view)
    - Query 2: All classes (v_module_classes view)
    - Query 3: All methods (v_class_methods view)
    - Query 4: All parameters (bulk IN clause)
    - Query 5: All attributes (bulk query)
    - Query 6: All constants (bulk query)
  - Result: Reduced ~1,200 queries to 6 queries (99.5% reduction!)

- [x] **Task 3.2**: Refactor `get_module_classes()` - Completed in 3.1
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - Note: Bulk loading already implemented in Task 3.1

- [x] **Task 3.3**: Refactor `get_class_methods()` - Completed in 3.1
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - Note: Bulk loading already implemented in Task 3.1

- [x] **Task 3.4**: Playwright testing - explorer page ✅
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - Tested 3 different board architectures:
    1. **ESP32** (esp32_generic): 70 modules, machine module with 19 classes
    2. **RP2** (rpi_pico): 48 modules, board-specific rp2 module
    3. **STM32** (pybv11): 47 modules, pyb module with 21 classes + 42 functions
  - All boards load correctly
  - Module/class expansion works
  - No console errors across all tests

- [x] **Task 3.5**: Performance validation - tree loading ✅
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - **Query Reduction**: ~1,200 queries → 6 queries (99.5% reduction!)
  - **Example Board** (70 modules, 150 classes, 400 methods, 200 functions):
    - Before: 1 + N×(1 + M×3 + P) = ~1,221 queries
    - After: 6 bulk queries
  - **Load Time**: Significantly improved (measured via browser DevTools)
  - **User Experience**: Instant module tree rendering

### Sprint 3 Exit Criteria - All Met
- ✅ Explorer uses views for module/class/method loading
- ✅ All explorer functionality works (validated with Playwright across 3 boards)
- ✅ Tree loading much faster (99.5% query reduction)
- ✅ Reduced query count (N+1 problem completely eliminated)
- ✅ Code complexity reduced (single refactored function handles all loading)

### Sprint 3 Key Achievements

**Technical Improvements**:
- Eliminated massive N+1+M+K query cascade
- Implemented bulk query strategy with in-memory assembly
- Used database views for consistency with search functionality
- Single point of maintenance for module loading logic

**Testing Coverage**:
- ✅ ESP32 architecture (70 modules)
- ✅ RP2 architecture (48 modules) 
- ✅ STM32 architecture (47 modules)
- ✅ Module expansion (machine, pyb, rp2 modules)
- ✅ Class expansion (Pin class with 16 methods + 19 attributes)
- ✅ Zero console errors

**Performance Gains**:
- **99.5% query reduction**: 1,200+ queries → 6 queries
- **Instant rendering**: No perceptible delay loading module tree
- **Scalability**: Performance independent of module/class/method count

### Sprint 3 Lessons Learned

1. **Bulk Queries Beat N+1**: The dramatic improvement shows the value of fetching all data upfront and assembling in memory rather than cascading individual queries.

2. **Views Simplify Bulk Queries**: Using pre-defined views (v_board_modules, v_module_classes, v_class_methods) made the bulk query code cleaner and more maintainable.

3. **Tasks Can Consolidate**: Tasks 3.2 and 3.3 were rendered obsolete by comprehensive implementation in 3.1. Sometimes the best solution handles multiple requirements at once.

4. **Column Naming Matters**: Initial bug with `method_docstring` vs `docstring` highlighted importance of understanding view schemas. Quick fix, but reinforced need for documentation.

5. **Cross-Architecture Testing Essential**: Testing ESP32, RP2, and STM32 boards revealed the solution works across diverse board types with different module sets.

6. **Building on Previous Work**: The CSS click fixes from Sprint 2 carried over seamlessly, showing value of fixing UI issues early.

## Sprint 3 - Loading Optimization ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Started**: 2025-10-23  
**Completed**: 2025-10-23  
**Time**: ~4 hours

### Sprint 2 Summary
Successfully refactored search functionality, reduced code by 76%, and fixed critical UX issues discovered during testing.

### Sprint 2 Tasks - All Complete

- [x] **Task 2.1**: Refactor `perform_search()` function
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - File: `tools/board_compare/frontend/search.py`
  - Action: Replace 6 entity-specific queries with single `v_board_entities` query
  - Result: Reduced from ~250 lines to ~60 lines (76% reduction)

- [x] **Task 2.2**: Update search result processing
  - Status: ✅ Complete (No changes needed)
  - Result: View schema compatible with existing processing logic

- [x] **Task 2.3**: Playwright MCP testing
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - Result: **Found and fixed 3 critical UX bugs**:
    1. **UnknownClass placeholders**: Search showed "empty class" entries for missing class IDs (34 warnings)
    2. **Empty modules**: Results included modules with no content (9 empty modules)
    3. **Broken click handlers**: Clicking chevrons/names didn't expand items (only full row worked)

- [x] **Task 2.4**: Performance validation
  - Status: ✅ Complete
  - Result: Performance competitive; view found more complete results

### Sprint 2 Bug Fixes Implemented

**Bug 1: UnknownClass Placeholders**
- **Root Cause**: Missing class IDs in database (34 cases) caused KeyError, fallback created "empty class" entries
- **Solution**: Filter out UnknownClass entries when building display tree (lines 404-411 in search.py)
- **Result**: Only real, expandable classes shown to users

**Bug 2: Empty Modules**
- **Root Cause**: Modules with no classes or constants were displayed as "empty module" entries
- **Solution**: Skip modules with `not classes_list and not module["constants"]` (lines 413-422 in search.py)
- **Result**: Search results reduced from 31→22 modules for "Pin" search (9 empty modules filtered)

**Bug 3: Broken Click Handlers (CSS Issue)**
- **Root Cause**: Chevron icons and text labels are child elements; clicks targeted children instead of parent with `mpy-click` handler
- **Solution**: Added CSS `pointer-events: none` to all children of `.tree-node` and `.module-header`
- **File**: `tools/board_compare/frontend/board-explorer-mpy.html`
- **Result**: All clicking behaviors now work perfectly (chevrons, names, and rows all expand/collapse)

### Sprint 2 Testing Results

**Comprehensive Playwright MCP Testing**:
- ✅ Search returns 360 results across 22 modules for "Pin"
- ✅ Empty modules filtered out (31→22)
- ✅ No UnknownClass placeholders visible
- ✅ Click chevron icon: expands/collapses ✅
- ✅ Click module/class name: expands/collapses ✅
- ✅ Click full row: expands/collapses ✅
- ✅ Multiple expand/collapse cycles work smoothly
- ✅ Class details show complete type signatures (19 methods, 19 attributes for Pin)
- ✅ Constants displayed correctly
- ✅ Modules with 1 class, 2 classes, and constants-only all work

### Sprint 2 Exit Criteria - All Met
- ✅ Search uses `v_board_entities` view
- ✅ All search functionality works (validated with Playwright)
- ✅ Playwright tests pass (comprehensive manual testing completed)
- ✅ Search performance validated (competitive, more complete results)
- ✅ Code complexity reduced (76% reduction)
- ✅ UX bugs discovered and fixed (3 major issues resolved)

## Lessons Learned

### Sprint 2 Insights
1. **Testing is Essential**: Playwright MCP testing revealed 3 critical bugs that weren't caught by code review
2. **UX Polish Matters**: Even with correct functionality, poor click targets severely impact usability
3. **Database Integrity**: Missing class IDs (34 cases) need to be addressed at database generation level
4. **CSS Event Handling**: Child elements need `pointer-events: none` for proper event bubbling to parent handlers
5. **Filter Early**: Removing empty/invalid results at processing stage (not rendering) keeps code cleaner
