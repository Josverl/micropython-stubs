# Sprint Progress Tracker

## Current Sprint: Sprint 2 - Search Optimization (Highest ROI)

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-10-23  
**Target Completion**: TBD

### Sprint 2 Goals
- Replace 6 search queries with 1 unified view query in `search.py`
- Maintain identical UX (no user-visible changes)
- Validate with Playwright tests
- Measure performance improvement

### Sprint 2 Tasks

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Refactor `perform_search()` function
  - Status: Not Started
  - File: `tools/board_compare/frontend/search.py`
  - Action: Replace 6 entity-specific queries with single `v_board_entities` query
  - Time Estimate: 2 hours

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Update search result processing
  - Status: Not Started
  - File: `tools/board_compare/frontend/search.py`
  - Action: Adapt result processing to unified view schema
  - Time Estimate: 1 hour

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Playwright test - search functionality
  - Status: Not Started
  - File: `tests/ui/test_search_with_views.py` (new)
  - Action: Automated UI test of search with real queries
  - Time Estimate: 2 hours

- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Performance validation
  - Status: Not Started
  - File: `tests/board_compare/benchmark_search.py` (new)
  - Action: Measure search latency before/after view adoption
  - Time Estimate: 1 hour

### Sprint 2 Exit Criteria
- [ ] Search uses `v_board_entities` view
- [ ] All search functionality works (manual testing)
- [ ] Playwright tests pass
- [ ] Search performance improved or neutral (not degraded)
- [ ] Code complexity reduced (fewer lines, clearer logic)
