# Detailed Installation Guide

The following will help you install the MicroPython Stubs for your specific port and board, or for a specific version of MicroPython.

(install_port)=
## Install Stubs for a specific port

If you only know the [MicroPython port](micropython_port) then that is sufficient. 
This will install the stubs for a generic board for that port of micropython.

```bash
pip install -U micropython-<port>-stubs --target typing --no-user
pip install -U micropython-esp32-stubs  --target typing --no-user
```

(install_version)=
## Install Stubs for a Specific Version

To install stubs for an older version (e.g., MicroPython 1.18), specify the version followed by  `.*` :

> [Note]
> 
> The stub packages are published as post-releases using the same M.M.M version numbering, allowing the stubs to be updated while keeping a clear reference to the MicroPython version.

```bash
pip install -U micropython-<port>-stubs==1.18.* --target typing --no-user
pip install -U micropython-esp32-stubs==1.18.* --target typing --no-user
```
(install_board)=
## Install Stubs for a Specific Board

For a specific [MicroPython board](micropython_board) (e.g., ESP32 UM-TinyPico), install both the port and board stubs:

```bash
pip install -U micropython-<port>-<board>-stubs  --target typing --no-user
pip install -U micropython-esp32-um-tinypico-stubs  --target typing --no-user
```

:::{note}

- The BOARD_NAMES are commonly in ALL_CAPS with all spaces replaced by _ 
- They should be the same as the name of the board folder in the micropython repo.
- PyPi converts port and board names to lowercase with kebab-case (not snake_case).
- Not all possible ports/boards are published, as creating board-stubs requires access to hardware.
- Some boards have been renamed between versions such as the rp2 PICO to RPI_PICO and several boards have switched from lowercase to all_caps
- Check PyPi directly for newly published stubs.

And thatâ€™s it! 

Youâ€™re all set to write MicroPython code with the help of these powerful stubs.
