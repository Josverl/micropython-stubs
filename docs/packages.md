:::{note}

- PyPi transforms all names of the ports and boards to small-caps and kebab-case, (not snake_case).
- Not all possible ports/boards are published as I do not have access to hardware to create board-stubs for all ports and boards.
- Newly published stubs may show as 'not found', please [check PyPi directly](https://pypi.org/search/?q=micropython+-stubs&o=&c=Programming+Language+%3A%3A+Python+%3A%3A+Implementation+%3A%3A+MicroPython)
