#### 5. Configure Your IDE

Configure your IDE (or other tools) to use the stubs:

- If using a virtual environment, most tools will automatically detect the stubs.
- If not using a virtual environment, configure the tool with the stubsâ€™ location (unless it defaults to `typings`).
- Specify the Python language version (MicroPython is based on Python 3.5 with some features from later versions).

And thatâ€™s it!

Youâ€™re all set to write MicroPython code with the help of these powerful stubs.

For more details, check out the [MicroPython Stubs documentation](https://micropython-stubs.readthedocs.io/). You can also explore the [full overview of all stubs](https://micropython-stubs.readthedocs.io/). ðŸ˜Š
