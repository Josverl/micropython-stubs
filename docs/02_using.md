# Using the stubs

In order to use the stubs you need to do a few things:  
## Clone or download a copy of the Micropython-Stubs repo
 1.  Download a copy of this repo , either via `git clone` or by download a zip file with it's contents
     - store this in a folder, for example 'next to' your software projects such as in `c:\develop\micropython-stubs`  
     this contains a `stubs` folder that contains all stubs
     ```
    git clone 
     ```

 2. Over time you may want to periodically update this folder using `git pull`

# Project configuration 
For each project where you want to use the stubs you 
this is not as complex as it seems,

##  **Create a symlink to the stubs folder**  
Create a symlink to the `c:\develop\micropython-stubs\stubs` from inside your project.
This will allow you to reference the same stub files from multiple projects, and limit the space
needed. This a recommendation, and things work equally well if you copy or clone the `stubs` folder into your project.  
For details on how to create a symlink, please see : {ref}`create-symbolic-link`

##  **Copy the [samples][] folder to your project**  
This contains the template files you need to improve syntax highlighting and linting.

##  **Select which stub folders you need to reference**  
- The order will influence results. place the 'higher quality' folders first.
- Use forward slashes `/` rather than backslashes, also on Windows.
- for example for micropython 1.13 on an ESP32 select:
    1. "./src/lib",
    2. "all-stubs/cpython_patch",
    3. "all-stubs/mpy_1_13-nightly_frozen/esp32/GENERIC", 
    4. "all-stubs/esp32_1_13_0-103",


##  **Configure VSCode to use the selected stub folders**  
This instructs the VSCode Pylance to consider your libs folder and the stubs for static code evaluation.
VSCode allows this configuration to be set on **_workspace_** or _user_ level. I prefer setting it per workspace as that allows different settings for different projects, but you could do either.
     
The below configuration is [Pylance][] specific
, and is simplified compared to the now deprecated 'Microsoft Python Language Server' 
     
    - use the {download}`samples/.VSCode/settings.json`  located in the sample folder
    - you can open this file in VSCode itself, or use the settings menu 
    - add the folders to the `python.autoComplete.extraPaths` section. 
    - it can be on a single line or split across lines. 
        - make sure it is a valid json array 

```json
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance",
    "python.analysis.autoSearchPath": true,
    "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
        "src/lib", 
        "all-stubs/cpython_patch", 
        "all-stubs/mpy_1_13-nightly_frozen/esp32/GENERIC", 
        "all-stubs/esp32_1_13_0-103",
    ]
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
```

## Optional: Configure pylint to use the selected stub folders
This instructs pylint to insert the list of paths into `sys.path` before performing linting, thus allowing it to find the stubs and use them to better validate your code. 

- use the {download}`.pylintcr sample file <samples/.pylintrc>`.

- edit the line that starts with `init-hook=`  
        ``` ini
        init-hook='import sys;sys.path[1:1] = ["src/lib", "folder1","folder2", "folder3",];'
        ```
- replace the folders with your selection of stub folders. **In this case they MUST be on a single line**
- the result should look like:
        ``` ini
        init-hook='import sys;sys.path[1:1] = ["src/lib", "all-stubs/cpython_patch","all-stubs/mpy_1_13-nightly_frozen/esp32/GENERIC", "all-stubs/esp32_1_13_0-103",];'
        ```

## **Restart VSCode**  
    VSCode must be restated for the Python language engine and Pylint to read the updated configuration.
    you can use: 
    - the `Developer: Reload Window` command.
    - or stop / start the editor
