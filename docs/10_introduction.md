# Introduction to MicroPython Stubs

![logo of pencil stubs](img/colorstubs.jpg){w=300px align=right}
Welcome to the MicroPython Stubs repository! Here, you’ll find a treasure trove of over 3,000 stub files generated by the MicroPython-Stubber tool. Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned developer, these stubs are designed to supercharge your MicroPython development process.

This repo stores stubs generated by the [MicroPython-Stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber#readme) tool 
which combines documentation with introspection to build a comprehensive set of stubs for MicroPython.

Currently over 3.000 stub files of multiple MicroPython versions and modules are available to help you :

- write code quicker
- with less errors,
- get help from code completion,
- use static type checking,
- and improve the overall development experience while writing [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/).

## What are type stubs?

Stubs are like cheat sheets for your code. They provide hints, auto-completion, and static type checking, making your life as a developer easier and more productive. Here’s what you can expect from these MicroPython Stubs:

1. **Faster Coding**: With stubs, you’ll write code more quickly and confidently. No more guessing function names or parameters!
2. **Fewer Errors**: Stubs help catch mistakes early. If you provide incorrect arguments, you’ll get immediate feedback.
3. **Code Completion**: Say goodbye to endless Googling. Stubs provide context-aware auto-completion, even for board-specific features.
4. **Static Type Checking**: By adding typing information, you’ll catch type-related bugs before they cause runtime issues.

The stubs are packaged and published to PyPi as [Pep 561 stub-only](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#stub-only-packages) packages to allow them to be installed and used with ease.

Type stubs are used by IDEs, linters, and static type checkers to provide a better development experience. They’re especially useful for MicroPython, where the dynamic nature of the language , and the differences between the different ports and boards can make it hard to catch errors early.

## Benefits of using MicroPython Stubs

If you:

- Use a modern Editor or IDE that supports Python static type checking
- Install the MicroPython Stubs on you computer (not on the MCU)
- Add some basic configuration to your IDE
- Use static type checking in your development process

Y=ou can benefit from:

- MicroPython specific auto completion, of arguments and things like board specific Pin names
- Tooltips with documentation of the MicroPython stdlib and included modules , specific to you port and board
- Direct feedback or errors if you provide incorrect parameters to functions or methods
- Adding additional checks to you CI/CD Pipelines to catch errors before they are merged into the main branch
- Refactor with confidence, knowing that the type checker will help you catch more errors.
